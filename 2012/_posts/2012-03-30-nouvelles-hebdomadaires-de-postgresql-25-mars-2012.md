<li>In pg_upgrade, remove dependency on pg_config, as that might not be in the non-development install. Instead, use the LOAD mechanism to check for the pg_upgrade_support shared object, like we do for other shared object checks. Backpatch to 9.1. Report from Alvaro Herrera

<li>plperl: Package-qualify _TD. Failing to do so causes trigger invocation to fail when they are nested within a function invocation that changes the current package. Backpatch to 9.1; previous releases used a different method to obtain _TD. Per bug report from Mark Murawski (bug #6511) Author: Alex Hunsaker 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/814e08e895a037e3f5485000db5964cd68dbfa01">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/814e08e895a037e3f5485000db5964cd68dbfa01</a></li>

<li>pg_dump: fix double free of query results. This bug was introduced while refactoring in commit 1631598e --- no need to back-patch. Bug report and fix from Joachim Wieland. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/77503a7638a35eedd9cb08d9ca4c54deb203521d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/77503a7638a35eedd9cb08d9ca4c54deb203521d</a></li>

<li>Update struct Trigger in docs

<li>Fix trigger example code to match header changes. I should have done this in b93f5a5673b4bb09e14eb80fe28aa21fc20a6271 but didn't notice the problem at the time. Per report from Marco Nenciarini 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b251cf31936b4507ad8ba78f34a14f592c664f43">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b251cf31936b4507ad8ba78f34a14f592c664f43</a></li>

<li>pg_dump: get rid of die_horribly. The old code was using exit_horribly or die_horribly other depending on whether it had an ArchiveHandle on which to close the connection or not; but there were places that were passing a NULL ArchiveHandle to die_horribly, and other places that used exit_horribly while having an ArchiveHandle available. So there wasn't all that much consistency. Improve the situation by keeping only one of the routines, and instead of having to pass the Alvaro Herrera down from the caller, arrange for it to be present for an on_exit_nicely callback to operate on. Author: Joachim Wieland. Some tweaks by me Per a suggestion from Robert Haas, in the ongoing "parallel pg_dump" saga.

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Restructure SELECT INTO's parsetree representation into CreateTableAsStmt. Making this operation look like a utility statement seems generally a good idea, and particularly so in light of the desire to provide command triggers for utility statements. The original choice of representing it as SELECT with an IntoClause appendage had metastasized into rather a lot of places, unfortunately, so that this patch is a great deal more complicated than one might at first expect. In particular, keeping EXPLAIN working for SELECT INTO and CREATE TABLE Alexander Shulgin subcommands required restructuring some EXPLAIN-related APIs. Add-on code that calls ExplainOnePlan or ExplainOneUtility, or uses ExplainOneQuery_hook, will need adjustment. Also, the cases PREPARE ... SELECT INTO and CREATE RULE ... SELECT INTO, which formerly were accepted though undocumented, are no longer accepted. The PREPARE case can be replaced with use of CREATE TABLE Alexander Shulgin EXECUTE. The CREATE RULE case doesn't seem to have much real-world use (since the rule would work only once before failing with "table already exists"), so we'll not bother with that one. Both SELECT INTO and CREATE TABLE Alexander Shulgin still return a command tag of "SELECT nnnn". There was some discussion of returning "CREATE TABLE nnnn", but for the moment backwards compatibility wins the day. Andres Freund and Tom Lane 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9dbf2b7d75de5af38d087cbe2b1147dd0fd10f0a">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9dbf2b7d75de5af38d087cbe2b1147dd0fd10f0a</a></li>

<li>Improve the -l (limit) option recently added to contrib/vacuumlo. Instead of just stopping after removing an arbitrary subset of orphaned large objects, commit and start a new transaction after each -l objects. This is just as effective as the original patch at limiting the number of locks used, and it doesn't require doing the OID collection process repeatedly to get everything. Since the option no longer changes the fundamental behavior of vacuumlo, and it avoids a known server-side limitation, enable it by default (with a default limit of 1000 LOs per transaction). In passing, be more careful about properly quoting the names of tables and fields, and do some other cosmetic cleanup. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/64c604898e812aa93c124c666e8709fff1b8dd26">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/64c604898e812aa93c124c666e8709fff1b8dd26</a></li>

<li>Back-patch contrib/vacuumlo's new -l (limit) option into 9.0 and 9.1. Since 9.0, removing lots of large objects in a single transaction risks exceeding max_locks_per_transaction, because we merged large object removal into the generic object-drop mechanism, which takes out an exclusive lock on each object to be dropped. This creates a hazard for contrib/vacuumlo, which has historically tried to drop all unreferenced large objects in one transaction. There doesn't seem to be any correctness requirement to do it that way, though; we only need to drop enough large objects per transaction to amortize the commit costs. To prevent a regression from pre-9.0 releases wherein vacuumlo worked just fine, back-patch commits b69f2e36402aaa222ed03c1769b3de6d5be5f302 and 64c604898e812aa93c124c666e8709fff1b8dd26, which break vacuumlo's deletions into multiple transactions with a user-controllable upper limit on the number of objects dropped per transaction.

<li>Allow new relmapper entries when allow_system_table_mods is true. This restores the pre-9.0 situation that it's possible to add new indexes on pg_class and other mapped-but-not-shared catalogs, so long as you broke the glass and flipped the big red Dont-Touch-Me switch. As before, there are a lot of gotchas, and you'd have to be pretty desperate to try this on a production database; but there doesn't seem to be a reason for relmapper.c to be preventing such things all by itself. Per experimentation with a case suggested by Cody Cutrer.

<li>Fix configure's search for collateindex.pl. PGAC_PATH_COLLATEINDEX supposed that it could use AC_PATH_PROGS to search for collateindex.pl, but that macro will only accept files that are marked executable, and at least some DocBook installations don't mark the script executable (a case the docs Makefile was already prepared for). Accept the script if it's present and readable in $DOCBOOKSTYLE/bin, and otherwise search the PATH as before. Having fixed that up, we don't need the fallback case that was in the docs Makefile, and instead can throw an understandable error if configure didn't find the script. Per recent trouble report from John Lumby.

<li>If a role has a password expiration date, show that in psql's \du output. Per a suggestion from Euler Taveira, it seems like a good idea to include this information in \du (and \dg) output. This costs nothing for people who are not using the VALID UNTIL feature, while for those who are, it's rather critical information. Fabr&iacute;zio de Royes Mello

<li>Refactor to eliminate duplicate copies of conninfo default-finding code. Alexander Shulgin, lightly edited by me.

<li>Fix GET DIAGNOSTICS for case of assignment to function's first variable. An incorrect and entirely unnecessary "safety check" in exec_stmt_getdiag() caused the code to treat an assignment to a variable with dno zero as a no-op. Unfortunately, that's a perfectly valid dno. This has been broken since GET DIAGNOSTICS was invented. It's not terribly surprising that the bug went unnoticed for so long, since in most cases you probably wouldn't use the function's first-created variable (normally its first parameter) as a GET DIAGNOSTICS target. Nonetheless, it's broken. Per bug #6551 from Adam Buraczewski.

<li>Code review for protransform patches. Fix loss of previous expression-simplification work when a transform function fires: we must not simply revert to untransformed input tree. Instead build a dummy FuncExpr node to pass to the transform function. This has the additional advantage of providing a simpler, more uniform API for transform functions. Move documentation to a somewhat less buried spot, relocate some poorly-placed code, be more wary of null constants and invalid typmod values, add an opr_sanity check on protransform function signatures, and some other minor cosmetic adjustments. Note: although this patch touches pg_proc.h, no need for catversion bump, because the changes are cosmetic and don't actually change the intended catalog contents.

<li>Refactor simplify_function et al to centralize argument simplification. We were doing the recursive simplification of function/operator arguments in half a dozen different places, with rather baroque logic to ensure it didn't get done multiple times on some arguments. This patch improves that by postponing argument simplification until after we've dealt with named parameters and added any needed default expressions. Marti Raudsepp, somewhat hacked on by me

<li>Cast some printf arguments to avoid possibly-nonportable behavior. Per compiler warnings on buildfarm member black_firefly.

<li>Fix planner's handling of outer PlaceHolderVars within subqueries. For some reason, in the original coding of the PlaceHolderVar mechanism I had supposed that PlaceHolderVars couldn't propagate into subqueries. That is of course entirely possible. When it happens, we need to treat an outer-level PlaceHolderVar much like an outer Var or Aggref, that is SS_replace_correlation_vars() needs to replace the PlaceHolderVar with a Param, and then when building the finished SubPlan we have to provide the PlaceHolderVar expression as an actual parameter for the SubPlan. The handling of the contained expression is a bit delicate but it can be treated exactly like an Aggref's expression. In addition to the missing logic in subselect.c, prepjointree.c was failing to search subqueries for PlaceHolderVars that need their relids adjusted during subquery pullup. It looks like everyplace else that touches PlaceHolderVars got it right, though. Per report from Mark Murawski. In 9.1 and HEAD, queries affected by this oversight would fail with "ERROR: Upper-level PlaceHolderVar found where not expected". But in 9.0 and 8.4, you'd silently get possibly-wrong answers, since the value transmitted into the subquery wouldn't go to null when it should. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8279eb4191c7ab9920c72ec8eec5df0e7b8c7530">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8279eb4191c7ab9920c72ec8eec5df0e7b8c7530</a></li>

<li>Replace empty locale name with implied value in CREATE DATABASE and initdb. setlocale() accepts locale name "" as meaning "the locale specified by the process's environment variables". Historically we've accepted that for Postgres' locale settings, too. However, it's fairly unsafe to store an empty string in a new database's pg_database.datcollate or datctype fields, because then the interpretation could vary across postmaster restarts, possibly resulting in index corruption and other unpleasantness. Instead, we should expand "" to whatever it means at the moment of calling CREATE DATABASE, which we can do by saving the value returned by setlocale(). For consistency, make initdb set up the initial lc_xxx parameter values the same way. initdb was already doing the right thing for empty locale names, but it did not replace non-empty names with setlocale results. On a platform where setlocale chooses to canonicalize the spellings of locale names, this would result in annoying inconsistency. (It seems that popular implementations of setlocale don't do such canonicalization, which is a pity, but the POSIX spec certainly allows it to be done.) The same risk of inconsistency leads me to not venture back-patching this, although it could certainly be seen as a longstanding bug. Per report from Jeff Davis, though this is not his proposed patch. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c7cea267de3ca05b29a57b9d113b95ef3793c8d8">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c7cea267de3ca05b29a57b9d113b95ef3793c8d8</a></li>

<li>Fix COPY FROM for null marker strings that correspond to invalid encoding. The COPY documentation says "COPY FROM matches the input against the null string before removing backslashes". It is therefore reasonable to presume that null markers like E'\\0' will work ... and they did, until someone put the tests in the wrong order during microoptimization-driven rewrites. Since then, we've been failing if the null marker is something that would de-escape to an invalidly-encoded string. Since null markers generally need to be something that can't appear in the data, this represents a nontrivial loss of functionality; surprising nobody noticed it earlier. Per report from Jeff Davis. Backpatch to 8.4 where this got broken.

<li>pg_dump: Remove undocumented "files" output format. This was for demonstration only, and now it was creating compiler warnings from zlib without an obvious fix (see also d923125b77c5d698bb8107a533a21627582baa43), let's just remove it. The "directory" format is presumably similar enough anyway.

<li>Add some CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() calls to the heap-sort call path. I broke this in commit 337b6f5ecf05b21b5e997986884d097d60e4e3d0, which among other things arranged for quicksorts to CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() slightly less frequently.
