<p><strong>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</strong></p>

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix SELECT DISTINCT with index-optimized MIN/MAX on inheritance trees. In a query such as "SELECT DISTINCT min(x) FROM tab", the DISTINCT is pretty useless (there being only one output row), but nonetheless it shouldn't fail. But it could fail if "tab" is an inheritance parent, because planagg.c's code for fixing up equivalence classes after making the index-optimized MIN/MAX transformation wasn't prepared to find child-table versions of the aggregate expression. The least ugly fix seems to be to add an option to mutate_eclass_expressions() to skip child-table equivalence class members, which aren't used anymore at this stage of planning so it's not really necessary to fix them. Since child members are ignored in many cases already, it seems plausible for mutate_eclass_expressions() to have an option to ignore them too. Per bug #7703 from Maxim Boguk. Back-patch to 9.1. Although the same code exists before that, it cannot encounter child-table aggregates AFAICS, because the index optimization transformation cannot succeed on inheritance trees before 9.1 (for lack of MergeAppend). 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d3237e04ca380d6c08f6133fde97a9d956e3161a">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d3237e04ca380d6c08f6133fde97a9d956e3161a</a></li>

<li>Revert patch for taking fewer snapshots. This reverts commit d573e239f03506920938bf0be56c868d9c3416da, "Take fewer snapshots". While that seemed like a good idea at the time, it caused execution to use a snapshot that had been acquired before locking any of the tables mentioned in the query. This created user-visible anomalies that were not present in any prior release of Postgres, as reported by Tomas Vondra. While this whole area could do with a redesign (since there are related cases that have anomalies anyway), it doesn't seem likely that any future patch would be reasonably back-patchable; and we don't want 9.2 to exhibit a behavior that's subtly unlike either past or future releases. Hence, revert to prior code while we rethink the problem. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/532994299e2ff208a58376134fab75f5ae471e41">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/532994299e2ff208a58376134fab75f5ae471e41</a></li>

<li>Add explicit casts in ilist.h's inline functions. Needed to silence C++ errors, per report from Peter Eisentraut. Andres Freund 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e78d288c895bd296e3cb1ca29c7fe2431eef3fcd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e78d288c895bd296e3cb1ca29c7fe2431eef3fcd</a></li>

<li>Fix assorted bugs in CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY. Commit 8cb53654dbdb4c386369eb988062d0bbb6de725e, which introduced DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY, managed to break CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY via a poor choice of catalog state representation. The pg_index state for an index that's reached the final pre-drop stage was the same as the state for an index just created by CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY. This meant that the (necessary) change to make RelationGetIndexList ignore about-to-die indexes also made it ignore freshly-created indexes; which is catastrophic because the latter do need to be considered in HOT-safety decisions. Failure to do so leads to incorrect index entries and subsequently wrong results from queries depending on the concurrently-created index. To fix, add an additional boolean column "indislive" to pg_index, so that the freshly-created and about-to-die states can be distinguished. (This change obviously is only possible in HEAD. This patch will need to be back-patched, but in 9.2 we'll use a kluge consisting of overloading the formerly-impossible state of indisvalid = true and indisready = false.) In addition, change CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY so that the pg_index flag changes they make without exclusive lock on the index are made via heap_inplace_update() rather than a normal transactional update. The latter is not very safe because moving the pg_index tuple could result in concurrent SnapshotNow scans finding it twice or not at all, thus possibly resulting in index corruption. This is a pre-existing bug in CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, which was copied into the DROP code. In addition, fix various places in the code that ought to check to make sure that the indexes they are manipulating are valid and/or ready as appropriate. These represent bugs that have existed since 8.2, since a failed CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY could leave a corrupt or invalid index behind, and we ought not try to do anything that might fail with such an index. Also fix RelationReloadIndexInfo to ensure it copies all the pg_index columns that are allowed to change after initial creation. Previously we could have been left with stale values of some fields in an index relcache entry. It's not clear whether this actually had any user-visible consequences, but it's at least a bug waiting to happen. In addition, do some code and docs review for DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY; some cosmetic code cleanup but mostly addition and revision of comments. This will need to be back-patched, but in a noticeably different form, so I'm committing it to HEAD before working on the back-patch. Problem reported by Amit Kapila, diagnosis by Pavan Deolassee, fix by Tom Lane and Andres Freund. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3c84046490bed3c22e0873dc6ba492e02b8b9051">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3c84046490bed3c22e0873dc6ba492e02b8b9051</a></li>

<li>Suppress parallel build in interfaces/ecpg/preproc/. This is to see if it will stop intermittent build failures on buildfarm member okapi. We know that gmake 3.82 has some problems with sometimes not honoring dependencies in parallel builds, and it seems likely that this is more of the same. Since the vast bulk of the work in the preproc directory is associated with creating preproc.c and then preproc.o, parallelism buys us hardly anything here anyway. Also, make both this .NOTPARALLEL and the one previously added in interfaces/ecpg/Makefile be conditional on "ifeq ($(MAKE_VERSION),3.82)". The known bug in gmake is fixed upstream and should not be present in 3.83 and up, and there's no reason to think it affects older releases.

<li>Produce a more useful error message for over-length Unix socket paths. The length of a socket path name is constrained by the size of struct sockaddr_un, and there's not a lot we can do about it since that is a kernel API. However, it would be a good thing if we produced an intelligible error message when the user specifies a socket path that's too long --- and getaddrinfo's standard API is too impoverished to do this in the natural way. So insert explicit tests at the places where we construct a socket path name. Now you'll get an error that makes sense and even tells you what the limit is, rather than something generic like "Non-recoverable failure in name resolution". Per trouble report from Jeremy Drake and a fix idea from Andrew Dunstan.

<li>Add missing buffer lock acquisition in GetTupleForTrigger(). If we had not been holding buffer pin continuously since the tuple was initially fetched by the UPDATE or DELETE query, it would be possible for VACUUM or a page-prune operation to move the tuple while we're trying to copy it. This would result in a garbage "old" tuple value being passed to an AFTER ROW UPDATE or AFTER ROW DELETE trigger. The preconditions for this are somewhat improbable, and the timing constraints are very tight; so it's not so surprising that this hasn't been reported from the field, even though the bug has been there a long time. Problem found by Andres Freund. Back-patch to all active branches.

<li>Take buffer lock while inspecting btree index pages in contrib/pageinspect. It's not safe to examine a shared buffer without any lock.

<li>Allow adding values to an enum type created in the current transaction. Normally it is unsafe to allow ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE in a transaction block, because instances of the value could be added to indexes later in the same transaction, and then they would still be accessible even if the transaction rolls back. However, we can allow this if the enum type itself was created in the current transaction, because then any such indexes would have to go away entirely on rollback. The reason for allowing this is to support pg_upgrade's new usage of pg_restore --single-transaction: in --binary-upgrade mode, pg_dump emits enum types as a succession of ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE commands so that it can preserve the values' OIDs. The support is a bit limited, so we'll leave it undocumented. Andres Freund

<li>Make sure sharedir/extension/ directory is created when needed. The previous coding worked as long as MODULEDIR wasn't set explicitly, because we create sharedir/$(datamoduledir) and the default value of that is "extension". But if some other value is specified for MODULEDIR then the installation directory needed for the control file wasn't made. C&eacute;dric Villemain

<li>Prevent passing gmake's environment variables down through pg_regress. When we do "make install" to create a temp installation, we don't want that instance of make to try to communicate with any instance of make that might be calling us. This is known to cause problems if the upper make has a -jN flag, and in principle could cause problems even without that. Unset the relevant environment variables to prevent such issues. Andres Freund

<li>Don't advance checkPoint.nextXid near the end of a checkpoint sequence. This reverts commit c11130690d6dca64267201a169cfb38c1adec5ef in favor of actually fixing the problem: namely, that we should never have been modifying the checkpoint record's nextXid at this point to begin with. The nextXid should match the state as of the checkpoint's logical WAL position (ie the redo point), not the state as of its physical position. It's especially bogus to advance it in some wal_levels and not others. In any case there is no need for the checkpoint record to carry the same nextXid shown in the XLOG_RUNNING_XACTS record just emitted by LogStandbySnapshot, as any replay operation will already have adopted that value as current. This fixes bug #7710 from Tarvi Pillessaar, and probably also explains bug #6291 from Daniel Farina, in that if a checkpoint were in progress at the instant of XID wraparound, the epoch bump would be lost as reported. (And, of course, these days there's at least a 50-50 chance of a checkpoint being in progress at any given instant.) Diagnosed by me and independently by Andres Freund. Back-patch to all branches supporting hot standby.

<li>Recommend triggers, not rules, in the CREATE VIEW reference page. We've generally recommended use of INSTEAD triggers over rules since that feature was added; but this old text in the CREATE VIEW reference page didn't get the memo. Noted by Thomas Kellerer.

<p>Heikki Linnakangas a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Add OpenTransientFile, with automatic cleanup at end-of-xact. Files opened with BasicOpenFile or PathNameOpenFile are not automatically cleaned up on error. That puts unnecessary burden on callers that only want to keep the file open for a short time. There is AllocateFile, but that returns a buffered FILE * stream, which in many cases is not the nicest API to work with. So add function called OpenTransientFile, which returns a unbuffered fd that's cleaned up like the FILE* returned by AllocateFile(). This plugs a few rare fd leaks in error cases: 1. copy_file() - fixed by by using OpenTransientFile instead of BasicOpenFile 2. XLogFileInit() - fixed by adding close() calls to the error cases. Can't use OpenTransientFile here because the fd is supposed to persist over transaction boundaries. 3. lo_import/lo_export - fixed by using OpenTransientFile instead of PathNameOpenFile. In addition to plugging those leaks, this replaces many BasicOpenFile() calls with OpenTransientFile() that were not leaking, because the code meticulously closed the file on error. That wasn't strictly necessary, but IMHO it's good for robustness. The same leaks exist in older versions, but given the rarity of the issues, I'm not backpatching this. Not yet, anyway - it might be good to backpatch later, after this mechanism has had some more testing in master branch.

<li>If we don't have a backup-end-location, don't claim we've reached it. This was apparently a typo, which caused recovery to think that it immediately reached the end of backup, and allowed the database to start up too early. Reported by Jeff Janes. Backpatch to 9.2, where this code was introduced.

<li>COPY FREEZE and mark committed on fresh tables. When a relfilenode is created in this subtransaction or a committed child transaction and it cannot otherwise be seen by our own process, mark tuples committed ahead of transaction commit for all COPY commands in same transaction. If FREEZE specified on COPY and pre-conditions met then rows will also be frozen. Both options designed to avoid revisiting rows after commit, increasing performance of subsequent commands after data load and upgrade. pg_restore changes later.

<li>XidEpoch++ if wraparound during checkpoint. If wal_level = hot_standby we update the checkpoint nextxid, though in the case where a wraparound occurred half-way through a checkpoint we would neglect updating the epoch also. Updating the nextxid is arguably the wrong thing to do, but changing that may introduce subtle bugs into hot standby startup, while updating the value doesn't cause any known bugs yet. Minimal fix now to HEAD and backbranches, wider fix later in HEAD. Bug reported in #6291 by Daniel Farina and slightly differently in Cause analysis and recommended fixes from Tom Lane and Andres Freund. Applied patch is minimal version of Andres Freund's work.

<li>Rearrange storage of data in xl_running_xacts. Previously we stored all xids mixed together. Now we store top-level xids first, followed by all subxids. Also skip logging any subxids if the snapshot is suboverflowed, since there are potentially large numbers of them and they are not useful in that case anyway. Has value in the envisaged design for decoding of WAL. No planned effect on Hot Standby. Andres Freund, reviewed by me

Normally each module is tested in aq database named contrib_regression, which is dropped and recreated at the beginhning of each pg_regress run. This mode, enabled by adding USE_MODULE_DB=1 to the make command line, runs most modules in a database with the module name embedded in it. This will make testing pg_upgrade on clusters with the contrib modules a lot easier. Still to be done: adapt to the MSVC build system. Backpatch to 9.0, which is the earliest version it is reasonably possible to test upgrading from.

<li>Move long_options structures to the top of main() functions, for consistency. Per suggestion from Tom.

<li>In pg_upgrade, dump each database separately and use --single-transaction to restore each database schema. This yields performance improvements for databases with many tables. Also, remove split_old_dump() as it is no longer needed.

<li>Split initdb.c main() code into multiple functions, for easier maintenance.

<li>In pg_upgrade, improve status wording now that we have per-database status output for dump/restore.
