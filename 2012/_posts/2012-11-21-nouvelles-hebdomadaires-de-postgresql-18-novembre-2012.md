<ul>

<li>Silence "expression result unused" warnings in AssertVariableIsOfTypeMacro. At least clang 3.1 generates those warnings. Prepend (void) to avoid them, like we have in AssertMacro. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c9d44a75d48ed8a9b9275b95be1fadaa562f3826">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c9d44a75d48ed8a9b9275b95be1fadaa562f3826</a></li>

<li>Use correct text domain for translating errcontext() messages. errcontext() is typically used in an error context callback function, not within an ereport() invocation like e.g errmsg and errdetail are. That means that the message domain that the TEXTDOMAIN magic in ereport() determines is not the right one for the errcontext() calls. The message domain needs to be determined by the C file containing the errcontext() call, not the file containing the ereport() call. Fix by turning errcontext() into a macro that passes the TEXTDOMAIN to use for the errcontext message. "errcontext" was used in a few places as a variable or struct field name, I had to rename those out of the way, now that errcontext is a macro. We've had this problem all along, but this isn't doesn't seem worth backporting. It's a fairly minor issue, and turning errcontext from a function to a macro requires at least a recompile of any external code that calls errcontext().

<li>Use a stamp file for the XSLT HTML doc build. This way it works more like the DSSSL build, and dependencies are tracked better by make. Also copy the CSS stylesheet to the html directory. This was forgotten when the output directory was changed.

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix multiple problems in WAL replay. Most of the replay functions for WAL record types that modify more than one page failed to ensure that those pages were locked correctly to ensure that concurrent queries could not see inconsistent page states. This is a hangover from coding decisions made long before Hot Standby was added, when it was hardly necessary to acquire buffer locks during WAL replay at all, let alone hold them for carefully-chosen periods. The key problem was that RestoreBkpBlocks was written to hold lock on each page restored from a full-page image for only as long as it took to update that page. This was guaranteed to break any WAL replay function in which there was any update-ordering constraint between pages, because even if the nominal order of the pages is the right one, any mixture of full-page and non-full-page updates in the same record would result in out-of-order updates. Moreover, it wouldn't work for situations where there's a requirement to maintain lock on one page while updating another. Failure to honor an update ordering constraint in this way is thought to be the cause of bug #7648 from Daniel Farina: what seems to have happened there is that a btree page being split was rewritten from a full-page image before the new right sibling page was written, and because lock on the original page was not maintained it was possible for hot standby queries to try to traverse the page's right-link to the not-yet-existing sibling page. To fix, get rid of RestoreBkpBlocks as such, and instead create a new function RestoreBackupBlock that restores just one full-page image at a time. This function can be invoked by WAL replay functions at the points where they would otherwise perform non-full-page updates; in this way, the physical order of page updates remains the same no matter which pages are replaced by full-page images. We can then further adjust the logic in individual replay functions if it is necessary to hold buffer locks for overlapping periods. A side benefit is that we can simplify the handling of concurrency conflict resolution by moving that code into the record-type-specfic functions; there's no more need to contort the code layout to keep conflict resolution in front of the RestoreBkpBlocks call. In connection with that, standardize on zero-based numbering rather than one-based numbering for referencing the full-page images. In HEAD, I removed the macros XLR_BKP_BLOCK_1 through XLR_BKP_BLOCK_4. They are still there in the header files in previous branches, but are no longer used by the code. In addition, fix some other bugs identified in the course of making these changes: spgRedoAddNode could fail to update the parent downlink at all, if the parent tuple is in the same page as either the old or new split tuple and we're not doing a full-page image: it would get fooled by the LSN having been advanced already. This would result in permanent index corruption, not just transient failure of concurrent queries. Also, ginHeapTupleFastInsert's "merge lists" case failed to mark the old tail page as a candidate for a full-page image; in the worst case this could result in torn-page corruption. heap_xlog_freeze() was inconsistent about using a cleanup lock or plain exclusive lock: it did the former in the normal path but the latter for a full-page image. A plain exclusive lock seems sufficient, so change to that. Also, remove gistRedoPageDeleteRecord(), which has been dead code since VACUUM FULL was rewritten. Back-patch to 9.0, where hot standby was introduced. Note however that 9.0 had a significantly different WAL-logging scheme for GIST index updates, and it doesn't appear possible to make that scheme safe for concurrent hot standby queries, because it can leave inconsistent states in the index even between WAL records. Given the lack of complaints from the field, we won't work too hard on fixing that branch. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3bbf668de9f1bc172371681e80a4e769b6d014c8">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3bbf668de9f1bc172371681e80a4e769b6d014c8</a></li>

<li>Fix memory leaks in record_out() and record_send(). record_out() leaks memory: it fails to free the strings returned by the per-column output functions, and also is careless about detoasted values. This results in a query-lifespan memory leakage when returning composite values to the client, because printtup() runs the output functions in the query-lifespan memory context. Fix it to handle these issues the same way printtup() does. Also fix a similar leakage in record_send(). (At some point we might want to try to run output functions in shorter-lived memory contexts, so that we don't need a zero-leakage policy for them. But that would be a significantly more invasive patch, which doesn't seem like material for back-patching.) In passing, use appendStringInfoCharMacro instead of appendStringInfoChar in the innermost data-copying loop of record_out, to try to shave a few cycles from this function's runtime. Per trouble report from Carlos Henrique Reimer. Back-patch to all supported versions.

<li>Fix the int8 and int2 cases of (minimum possible integer) % (-1). The correct answer for this (or any other case with arg2 = -1) is zero, but some machines throw a floating-point exception instead of behaving sanely. Commit f9ac414c35ea084ff70c564ab2c32adb06d5296f dealt with this in int4mod, but overlooked the fact that it also happens in int8mod (at least on my Linux x86_64 machine). Protect int2mod as well; it's not clear whether any machines fail there (mine does not) but since the test is so cheap it seems better safe than sorry. While at it, simplify the original guard in int4mod: we need only check for arg2 == -1, we don't need to check arg1 explicitly. Xi Wang, with some editing by me. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a235b85a0ba06666dbbfdb9249a65dbfa9b42ebd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a235b85a0ba06666dbbfdb9249a65dbfa9b42ebd</a></li>

<li>Improve check_partial_indexes() to consider join clauses in proof attempts. Traditionally check_partial_indexes() has only looked at restriction clauses while trying to prove partial indexes usable in queries. However, join clauses can also be used in some cases; mainly, that a strict operator on "x" proves an "x IS NOT NULL" index predicate, even if the operator is in a join clause rather than a restriction clause. Adding this code fixes a regression in 9.2, because previously we would take join clauses into account when considering whether a partial index could be used in a nestloop inner indexscan path. 9.2 doesn't handle nestloop inner indexscans in the same way, and this consideration was overlooked in the rewrite. Moving the work to check_partial_indexes() is a better solution anyway, since the proof applies whether or not we actually use the index in that particular way, and we don't have to do it over again for each possible outer relation. Per report from Dave Cramer.

<li>Assert that WaitLatch's timeout is not more than INT_MAX milliseconds. The behavior with larger values is unspecified by the Single Unix Spec. It appears that BSD-derived kernels report EINVAL, although Linux does not. If waiting for longer intervals is desired, the calling code has to do something to limit the delay; we can't portably fix it here since "long" may not be any wider than "int" in the first place. Part of response to bug #7670, though this change doesn't fix that (in fact, it converts the problem from an ERROR into an Assert failure). No back-patch since it's just an assertion addition. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/14ddff44c22cb358775d5aad6953f0ce0fdb64cf">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/14ddff44c22cb358775d5aad6953f0ce0fdb64cf</a></li>

<li>Fix syslogger to not fail when log_rotation_age exceeds 231 milliseconds. We need to avoid calling WaitLatch with timeouts exceeding INT_MAX. Fortunately a simple clamp will do the trick, since no harm is done if the wait times out before it's really time to rotate the log file. Per bug #7670 (probably bug #7545 is the same thing, too). In passing, fix bogus definition of log_rotation_age's maximum value in guc.c --- it was numerically right, but only because MINS_PER_HOUR and SECS_PER_MINUTE have the same value. Back-patch to 9.2. Before that, syslogger wasn't using WaitLatch. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d038966ddb918872700f9f21affbc84d6bc2c029">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d038966ddb918872700f9f21affbc84d6bc2c029</a></li>

<li>Limit values of archive_timeout, post_auth_delay, auth_delay.milliseconds. The previous definitions of these GUC variables allowed them to range up to INT_MAX, but in point of fact the underlying code would suffer overflows or other errors with large values. Reduce the maximum values to something that won't misbehave. There's no apparent value in working harder than this, since very large delays aren't sensible for any of these. (Note: the risk with archive_timeout is that if we're late checking the state, the timestamp difference it's being compared to might overflow. So we need some amount of slop; the choice of INT_MAX/2 is arbitrary.) Per followup investigation of bug #7670. Although this isn't a very significant fix, might as well back-patch.

<li>In pg_upgrade, copy fsm, vm, and extent files by checking for file existence via open(), rather than collecting a directory listing and looking up matching relfilenode files with sequential scans of the array. This speeds up pg_upgrade by 2x for a large number of tables, e.g. 16k. Per observation by Ants Aasma.
