<li>Support quorum-based synchronous replication. This feature is also known as "quorum commit" especially in discussion on pgsql-hackers. This commit adds the following new syntaxes into synchronous_standby_names GUC. By using FIRST and ANY keywords, users can specify the method to choose synchronous standbys from the listed servers. FIRST num_sync (standby_name [, ...]) ANY num_sync (standby_name [, ...]) The keyword FIRST specifies a priority-based synchronous replication which was available also in 9.6 or before. This method makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to num_sync synchronous standbys chosen based on their priorities. The keyword ANY specifies a quorum-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to *at least* num_sync listed standbys. In this method, the values of sync_state.pg_stat_replication for the listed standbys are reported as "quorum". The priority is still assigned to each standby, but not used in this method. The existing syntaxes having neither FIRST nor ANY keyword are still supported. They are the same as new syntax with FIRST keyword, i.e., a priorirty-based synchronous replication.

<li>Forbid invalid combination of options in pg_basebackup. Commit 56c7d8d4552180fd66fe48423bb2a9bb767c2d87 allowed pg_basebackup to stream WAL in tar mode. But there is the restriction that WAL streaming in tar mode works only when the value - (dash) is not specified as output directory. This means that the combination of three options "-D -", "-F t" and "-X stream" is invalid. However, previously, even when those options were specified at the same time, pg_basebackup background process unexpectedly started streaming WAL. And then it exited with an error. This commit changes pg_basebackup so that it errors out on such invalid combination of options at the beginning. Reviewed by Magnus Hagander, and patch by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ecbdc4c555f43b1ac284c734752b00c2ea6f277b">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ecbdc4c555f43b1ac284c734752b00c2ea6f277b</a></li>

<li>Remove unused file. This was added in 105409746499657acdffc109db9d343b464bda1f, but has never been used for anything as far as I can tell. There seems to be no reason to keep it. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/668dbbec27da05b35a6972e9d833115dce0b6ccc">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/668dbbec27da05b35a6972e9d833115dce0b6ccc</a></li>

<li>Fix locking problem in _hash_squeezebucket() / _hash_freeovflpage(). A bucket squeeze operation needs to lock each page of the bucket before releasing the prior page, but the previous coding fumbled the locking when freeing an overflow page during a bucket squeeze operation. Commit 6d46f4783efe457f74816a75173eb23ed8930020 introduced this bug. Amit Kapila, with help from Kuntal Ghosh and Dilip Kumar, after an initial trouble report by Jeff Janes. Reviewed by me. I also fixed a problem with a comment. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/dd728826c538f000220af98de025c00114ad0631">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/dd728826c538f000220af98de025c00114ad0631</a></li>

<li>Refactor merge path generation code. This shouldn't change the set of paths that get generated in any way, but it is preparatory work for further changes to allow a partial path to be merge-joined witih a non-partial path to produce a partial join path. Dilip Kumar, with cosmetic adjustments by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/59649c3f1cbd536314c0060dcabd234deab148b2">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/59649c3f1cbd536314c0060dcabd234deab148b2</a></li>

<li>Fix corner-case bug in WaitEventSetWaitBlock on Windows. If we do not reset the FD_READ event, WaitForMultipleObjects won't return it again again unless we've meanwhile read from the socket, which is generally true but not guaranteed. WaitEventSetWaitBlock itself may fail to return the event to the caller if the latch is also set, and even if we changed that, the caller isn't obliged to handle all returned events at once. On non-Windows systems, the socket-read event is purely level-triggered, so this issue does not exist. To fix, make Windows reset the event when needed. This bug was introduced by 98a64d0bd713cb89e61bef6432befc4b7b5da59e, and causes hangs when trying to use the pldebugger extension. Patch by Amit Kapial. Reported and tested by Ashutosh Sharma, who also provided some analysis.

<li>Convert elog() to ereport() and do some wordsmithing. It's not entirely clear that we should log a message here at all, but it's certainly wrong to use elog() for a message that should clearly be translatable.

<li>Code review for ATExecAttachPartition. Amit Langote. Most of this reported by &Atilde;lvaro Herrera. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3ee80672847c4100d5f9efdb9ea19cb96506d089">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3ee80672847c4100d5f9efdb9ea19cb96506d089</a></li>

<li>Fix broken error check in _hash_doinsert. You can't just cast a HashMetaPage to a Page, because the meta page data is stored after the page header, not at offset 0. Fortunately, this didn't break anything because it happens to find hashm_bsize at the offset at which it expects to find pd_pagesize_version, and the values are close enough to the same that this works out. Still, it's a bug, so back-patch to all supported versions. Mithun Cy, revised a bit by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/097e41439d69e11fb870e009b1ac64dda4f01c3d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/097e41439d69e11fb870e009b1ac64dda4f01c3d</a></li>

<li>Fix tuple routing in cases where tuple descriptors don't match. The previous coding failed to work correctly when we have a multi-level partitioned hierarchy where tables at successive levels have different attribute numbers for the partition key attributes. To fix, have each PartitionDispatch object store a standalone TupleTableSlot initialized with the TupleDesc of the corresponding partitioned table, along with a TupleConversionMap to map tuples from the its parent's rowtype to own rowtype. After tuple routing chooses a leaf partition, we must use the leaf partition's tuple descriptor, not the root table's. To that end, a dedicated TupleTableSlot for tuple routing is now allocated in EState.

<li>Remove _hash_chgbufaccess(). This is basically for the same reasons I got rid of _hash_wrtbuf() in commit 25216c98938495fd741bf585dcbef45b3a9ffd40: it's not convenient to have a function which encapsulates MarkBufferDirty(), especially as we move towards having hash indexes be WAL-logged. Patch by me, reviewed (but not entirely endorsed) by Amit Kapila. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7819ba1ef6c5297b7e27878d2b3d30c5bcef8939">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7819ba1ef6c5297b7e27878d2b3d30c5bcef8939</a></li>

<li>Fix handling of phrase operator removal while removing tsquery stopwords. The distance of a removed phrase operator should propagate up to a parent phrase operator if there is one, but this only worked correctly in left-deep trees. Throwing in a few parentheses confused it completely, as indeed was illustrated by bizarre results in existing regression test cases. To fix, track unaccounted-for distances that should propagate to the left and to the right of the current node, rather than trying to make it work with only one returned distance. Also make some adjustments to behave as well as we can for cases of intermixed phrase and regular (AND/OR) operators. I don't think it's possible to be 100% correct for that without a rethinking of the tsquery representation; for example, maybe we should just not drop stopword nodes at all underneath phrase operators. But this is better than it was, and changing tsquery representation wouldn't be safely back-patchable. While at it, I simplified the API of the clean_fakeval_intree function a bit by getting rid of the "char *result" output parameter; that wasn't doing anything that wasn't redundant with whether the result node is NULL or not, and testing for NULL seems a lot clearer/safer. This is part of a larger project to fix various infelicities in the phrase-search implementation, but this part seems comittable on its own. Back-patch to 9.6 where phrase operators were introduced.

<li>Fix minor error message style violation. Primary error messages should not end with a period, since they're generally not written as full sentences. Oversight in 41493bac3. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7d41a2bd3eef4de64ae8f6f683457f12f9407c5d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7d41a2bd3eef4de64ae8f6f683457f12f9407c5d</a></li>

<li>Fix minor oversights in nodeAgg.c. aggstate-&gt;evalproj is always set up by ExecInitAgg, so there's no need to test. Doing so led Coverity to think that we might be intending "slot" to be possibly NULL here, and it quite properly complained that the rest of combine_aggregates() wasn't prepared for that. Also fix a couple of obvious thinkos in Asserts checking that "inputoff" isn't past the end of the slot. Errors introduced in commit 8ed3f11bb, so no need for back-patch. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c080b223a7a3991524a5287416a0ad756c15a098">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c080b223a7a3991524a5287416a0ad756c15a098</a></li>

<li>Fix strange behavior (and possible crashes) in full text phrase search. In an attempt to simplify the tsquery matching engine, the original phrase search patch invented rewrite rules that would rearrange a tsquery so that no AND/OR/NOT operator appeared below a PHRASE operator. But this approach had numerous problems. The rearrangement step was missed by ts_rewrite (and perhaps other places), allowing tsqueries to be created that would cause Assert failures or perhaps crashes at execution, as reported by Andreas Seltenreich. The rewrite rules effectively defined semantics for operators underneath PHRASE that were buggy, or at least unintuitive. And because rewriting was done in tsqueryin() rather than at execution, the rearrangement was user-visible, which is not very desirable --- for example, it might cause unexpected matches or failures to match in ts_rewrite. As a somewhat independent problem, the behavior of nested PHRASE operators was only sane for left-deep trees; queries like "x &lt;-&gt; (y &lt;-&gt; z)" did not behave intuitively at all. To fix, get rid of the rewrite logic altogether, and instead teach the tsquery execution engine to manage AND/OR/NOT below a PHRASE operator by explicitly computing the match location(s) and match widths for these operators. This requires introducing some additional fields into the publicly visible ExecPhraseData struct; but since there's no way for third-party code to pass such a struct to TS_phrase_execute, it shouldn't create an ABI problem as long as we don't move the offsets of the existing fields. Another related problem was that index searches supposed that "!x &lt;-&gt; y" could be lossily approximated as "!x &amp; y", which isn't correct because the latter will reject, say, "x q y" which the query itself accepts. This required some tweaking in TS_execute_ternary along with the main tsquery engine. Back-patch to 9.6 where phrase operators were introduced. While this could be argued to change behavior more than we'd like in a stable branch, we have to do something about the crash hazards and index-vs-seqscan inconsistency, and it doesn't seem desirable to let the unintuitive behaviors induced by the rewriting implementation stand as precedent.

<li>Fix detection of unfinished Unicode surrogate pair at end of string. The U&amp;'...' and U&amp;"..." syntaxes silently discarded a surrogate pair start (that is, a code between U+D800 and U+DBFF) if it occurred at the very end of the string. This seems like an obvious oversight, since we throw an error for every other invalid combination of surrogate characters, including the very same situation in E'...' syntax. This has been wrong since the pair processing was added (in 9.0), so back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Give a useful error message if uuid-ossp is built without preconfiguration. Before commit b8cc8f947, it was possible to build contrib/uuid-ossp without having told configure you meant to; you could just cd into that directory and "make". That no longer works because the code depends on configure to have done header and library probes, but the ensuing error messages are not so easy to interpret if you're not an old C hand. We've gotten a couple of complaints recently from people trying to do this the low-tech way, so add an explicit #error directing the user to use --with-uuid.

<li>Fix handling of expanded objects in CoerceToDomain and CASE execution. When the input value to a CoerceToDomain expression node is a read-write expanded datum, we should pass a read-only pointer to any domain CHECK expressions and then return the original read-write pointer as the expression result. Previously we were blindly passing the same pointer to all the consumers of the value, making it possible for a function in CHECK to modify or even delete the expanded value. (Since a plpgsql function will absorb a passed-in read-write expanded array as a local variable value, it will in fact delete the value on exit.) A similar hazard of passing the same read-write pointer to multiple consumers exists in domain_check() and in ExecEvalCase, so fix those too. The fix requires adding MakeExpandedObjectReadOnly calls at the appropriate places, which is simple enough except that we need to get the data type's typlen from somewhere. For the domain cases, solve this by redefining DomainConstraintRef.tcache as okay for callers to access; there wasn't any reason for the original convention against that, other than not wanting the API of typcache.c to be any wider than it had to be. For CASE, there's no good solution except to add a syscache lookup during executor start. Per bug #14472 from Marcos Castedo. Back-patch to 9.5 where expanded values were introduced.

<li>Fix CREATE TABLE ... LIKE ... WITH OIDS. Having a WITH OIDS specification should result in the creation of an OID column, but commit b943f502b broke that in the case that there were LIKE tables without OIDS. Commentary in that patch makes it look like this was intentional, but if so it was based on a faulty reading of what inheritance does: the parent tables can add an OID column, but they can't subtract one. AFAICS, the behavior ought to be that you get an OID column if any of the inherited tables, LIKE tables, or WITH clause ask for one. Also, revert that patch's unnecessary split of transformCreateStmt's loop over the tableElts list into two passes. That seems to have been based on a misunderstanding as well: we already have two-pass processing here, we don't need three passes. Per bug #14474 from Jeff Dafoe. Back-patch to 9.6 where the misbehavior was introduced.

<li>Spellcheck: s/descendent/descendant/g. I got a little annoyed by reading documentation paragraphs containing both spellings within a few lines of each other. My dictionary says "descendant" is the preferred spelling, and it's certainly the majority usage in our tree, so standardize on that. For one usage in parallel.sgml, I thought it better to rewrite to avoid the term altogether. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ff33d1456ea098e160cbbc74b332656c06abc2ab">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ff33d1456ea098e160cbbc74b332656c06abc2ab</a></li>

<li>Doc: improve index entry for "median". We had an index entry for "median" attached to the percentile_cont function entry, which was pretty useless because a person following the link would never realize that that function was the one they were being hinted to use. Instead, make the index entry point at the example in syntax-aggregates, and add a &lt;seealso&gt; link to "percentile". Also, since that example explicitly claims to be calculating the median, make it use percentile_cont not percentile_disc. This makes no difference in terms of the larger goals of that section, but so far as I can find, nearly everyone thinks that "median" means the continuous not discrete calculation. Per gripe from Steven Winfield. Back-patch to 9.4 where we introduced percentile_cont.

<li>Replace enum InhOption with simple boolean. Now that it has only INH_NO and INH_YES values, it's just weird that it's not a plain bool, so make it that way. Also rename RangeVar.inhOpt to "inh", to be like RangeTblEntry.inh. My recollection is that we gave it a different name specifically because it had a different representation than the derived bool value, but it no longer does. And this is a good forcing function to be sure we catch any places that are affected by the change. Bump catversion because of possible effect on stored RangeVar nodes. I'm not exactly convinced that we ever store RangeVar on disk, but we have a readfuncs function for it, so be cautious. (If we do do so, then commit e13486eba was in error not to bump catversion.)

<li>Fix incorrect error reporting for duplicate data in \crosstabview. \crosstabview's complaint about multiple entries for the same crosstab cell quoted the wrong row and/or column values. It would accidentally appear to work if the data had been in strcmp() order to start with, which probably explains how we missed noticing this during development. This could be fixed in more than one way, but the way I chose was to hang onto both result pointers from bsearch() and use those to get at the value names. In passing, avoid casting away const in the bsearch comparison functions. No bug there, just poor style. Per bug #14476 from Tomonari Katsumata. Back-patch to 9.6 where \crosstabview was introduced.

<li>Fix sharing Agg transition state of DISTINCT or ordered aggs. If a query contained two aggregates that could share the transition value, we would correctly collect the input into a tuplesort only once, but incorrectly run the transition function over the accumulated input twice, in finalize_aggregates().

<li>Add pg_sequence system catalog. Move sequence metadata (start, increment, etc.) into a proper system catalog instead of storing it in the sequence heap object.

<li>Reorder pg_sequence columns to avoid alignment issue. On AIX, doubles are aligned at 4 bytes, but int64 is aligned at 8 bytes. Our code assumes that doubles have alignment that can also be applied to int64, but that fails in this case. One effect is that heap_form_tuple() writes tuples in a different layout than Form_pg_sequence expects. Rather than rewrite the whole alignment code, work around the issue by reordering the columns in pg_sequence so that the first int64 column naturally comes out at an 8-byte boundary. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f3b421da5f4addc95812b9db05a24972b8fd9739">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f3b421da5f4addc95812b9db05a24972b8fd9739</a></li>

<li>Fix order of operations in CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW. When CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW acts on an existing view, don't update the view options until after the view query has been updated. This is necessary in the case where CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is used on an existing view that is not updatable, and the new view is updatable and specifies the WITH CHECK OPTION. In this case, attempting to apply the new options to the view before updating its query fails, because the options are applied using the ALTER TABLE infrastructure which checks that WITH CHECK OPTION is only applied to an updatable view. If new columns are being added to the view, that is also done using the ALTER TABLE infrastructure, but it is important that that still be done before updating the view query, because the rules system checks that the query columns match those on the view relation. Added a comment to explain that, in case someone is tempted to move that to where the view options are now being set. Back-patch to 9.4 where WITH CHECK OPTION was added.

<li>Fix tab completion in psql for ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES. When providing tab completion for ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES, we are including the list of roles as possible options for completion after the GRANT or REVOKE. Further, we accept FOR ROLE/IN SCHEMA at the same time and in either order, but the tab completion was only working for one or the other. Lastly, we weren't using the actual list of allowed kinds of objects for default privileges for completion after the 'GRANT X ON' but instead were completeing to what 'GRANT X ON' supports, which isn't the ssame at all. Address these issues by improving the forward tab-completion for ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES and then constrain and correct how the tail completion is done when it is for ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES. Back-patch the forward/tail tab-completion to 9.6, where we made it easy to handle such cases. For 9.5 and earlier, correct the initial tab-completion to at least be correct as far as it goes and then add a check for GRANT/REVOKE to only tab-complete when the GRANT/REVOKE is the start of the command, so we don't try to do tab-completion after we get to the GRANT/REVOKE part of the ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES command, which is better than providing incorrect completions.

<li>Protect dblink from invalid options when using postgres_fdw server. When dblink uses a postgres_fdw server name for its connection, it is possible for the connection to have options that are invalid with dblink (e.g. "updatable"). The recommended way to avoid this problem is to use dblink_fdw servers instead. However there are use cases for using postgres_fdw, and possibly other FDWs, for dblink connection options, therefore protect against trying to use any options that do not apply by using is_valid_dblink_option() when building the connection string from the options. Back-patch to 9.3. Although 9.2 supports FDWs for connection info, is_valid_dblink_option() did not yet exist, and neither did postgres_fdw, at least in the postgres source tree. Given the lack of previous complaints, fixing that seems too invasive/not worth it.

<li>Make dblink try harder to form useful error messages. When libpq encounters a connection-level error, e.g. runs out of memory while forming a result, there will be no error associated with PGresult, but a message will be placed into PGconn's error buffer. postgres_fdw takes care to use the PGconn error message when PGresult does not have one, but dblink has been negligent in that regard. Modify dblink to mirror what postgres_fdw has been doing. Back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Improve RLS documentation with respect to COPY. Documentation for pg_restore said COPY TO does not support row security when in fact it should say COPY FROM. Fix that. While at it, make it clear that "COPY FROM" does not allow RLS to be enabled and INSERT should be used instead. Also that SELECT policies will apply to COPY TO statements. Back-patch to 9.5 where RLS first appeared.

<li>Skip checkpoints, archiving on idle systems. Some background activity (like checkpoints, archive timeout, standby snapshots) is not supposed to happen on an idle system. Unfortunately so far it was not easy to determine when a system is idle, which defeated some of the attempts to avoid redundant activity on an idle system. To make that easier, allow to make individual WAL insertions as not being "important". By checking whether any important activity happened since the last time an activity was performed, it now is easy to check whether some action needs to be repeated. Use the new facility for checkpoints, archive timeout and standby snapshots. The lack of a facility causes some issues in older releases, but in my opinion the consequences (superflous checkpoints / archived segments) aren't grave enough to warrant backpatching.
