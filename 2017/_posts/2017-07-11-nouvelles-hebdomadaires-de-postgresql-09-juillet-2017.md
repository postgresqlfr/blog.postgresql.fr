<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<p>Heikki Linnakangas pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Forbid gen_random_uuid() with --disable-strong-random. Previously, gen_random_uuid() would fall back to a weak random number generator, unlike gen_random_bytes() which would just fail. And this was not made very clear in the docs. For consistency, also make gen_random_uuid() fail outright, if compiled with --disable-strong-random. Re-word the error message you get with --disable-strong-random. It is also used by pgp functions that require random salts, and now also gen_random_uuid(). Reported by Radek Slupik.

<li>Treat clean shutdown of an SSL connection same as the non-SSL case. If the client closes an SSL connection, treat it the same as EOF on a non-SSL connection. In particular, don't write a message in the log about that. Michael Paquier.

<li>Improve subscription locking. This avoids "tuple concurrently updated" errors when a ALTER or DROP SUBSCRIPTION writes to pg_subscription_rel at the same time as a worker. Author: Petr Jelinek &lt;petr.jelinek@2ndquadrant.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cb9079cd51a2df677dc182aec72d88383b9c2a79">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cb9079cd51a2df677dc182aec72d88383b9c2a79</a></li>

<li>psql documentation fixes. Update the documentation for \pset to mention columns|linestyle|pager_min_lines. Add various mentions of \pset command equivalences that were previously inconsistent. Author: &#1044;&#1080;&#1083;&#1103;&#1085; &#1055;&#1072;&#1083;&#1072;&#1091;&#1079;&#1086;&#1074; &lt;dpa-postgres@aegee.org&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5191e357cf22e200a9baaf97bbe8a07ee2537537">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5191e357cf22e200a9baaf97bbe8a07ee2537537</a></li>

<li>Fix output of char node fields. WRITE_CHAR_FIELD() didn't do any escaping, so that for example a zero byte would cause the whole output string to be truncated. To fix, pass the char through outToken(), so it is escaped like a string. Adjust the reading side to handle this. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d80e73f2293429cf8a0a13c243852379ec2e37e2">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d80e73f2293429cf8a0a13c243852379ec2e37e2</a></li>

<li>pg_ctl: Make failure to complete operation a nonzero exit. If an operation being waited for does not complete within the timeout, then exit with a nonzero exit status. This was previously handled inconsistently. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1bac5f552a25aca3aa2ef1d404f7cdf7788c34d8">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1bac5f552a25aca3aa2ef1d404f7cdf7788c34d8</a></li>

<li>Remove unnecessary pg_is_in_recovery calls in tests. Since pg_ctl promote already waits for recovery to end, these calls are obsolete. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6deb52b202e0f673b583b03ad141ccad6f8e7fba">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6deb52b202e0f673b583b03ad141ccad6f8e7fba</a></li>

<li>Restore linking libpq into pg_ctl on Mingw builds. Commit 1ae853654 missed this. Per Andrew Dunstan. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ff68e909acd924b532e58c7699e93a1aff71654a">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ff68e909acd924b532e58c7699e93a1aff71654a</a></li>

<li>Fix another race-condition-ish issue in recovery/t/001_stream_rep.pl. Buildfarm members hornet and sungazer have shown multiple instances of "Failed test 'xmin of non-cascaded slot with hs feedback has changed'". The reason seems to be that the test is checking the current xmin of the master server's replication slot against a past xmin of the first slave server's replication slot. Even though the latter slot is downstream of the former, it's possible for its reported xmin to be ahead of the former's reported xmin, because those numbers are updated whenever the respective downstream walreceiver feels like it (see logic in WalReceiverMain). Instrumenting this test shows that indeed the slave slot's xmin does often advance before the master's does, especially if an autovacuum transaction manages to occur during the relevant window. If we happen to capture such an advanced xmin as $xmin, then the subsequent wait_slot_xmins call can fall through before the master's xmin has advanced at all, and then if it advances before the get_slot_xmins call, we can get the observed failure. Yeah, that's a bit of a long chain of deduction, but it's hard to explain any other way how the test can get past an "xmin &lt;&gt; '$xmin'" check only to have the next query find that xmin does equal $xmin. Fix by keeping separate images of the master and slave slots' xmins and testing their has-xmin-advanced conditions independently. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ec86af917551f52246848dd148885df034273f3d">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ec86af917551f52246848dd148885df034273f3d</a></li>

<li>Avoid unreferenced-function warning on low-functionality platforms. On platforms lacking both locale_t and ICU, collationcmds.c failed to make any use of its static function is_all_ascii(), thus probably drawing a compiler warning. Oversight in my commit ddb5fdc06. Per buildfarm member gaur. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ec4073f64130b40fabaa1b38ad402babda3a48eb">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ec4073f64130b40fabaa1b38ad402babda3a48eb</a></li>

<li>Simplify the logic checking new range partition bounds. The previous logic, whilst not actually wrong, was overly complex and involved doing two binary searches, where only one was really necessary. This simplifies that logic and improves the comments. One visible change is that if the new partition overlaps multiple existing partitions, the error message now always reports the overlap with the first existing partition (the one with the lowest bounds). The old code would sometimes report the clash with the first partition and sometimes with the last one. Original patch idea from Amit Langote, substantially rewritten by me.

<li>Clarify the contract of partition_rbound_cmp(). partition_rbound_cmp() is intended to compare range partition bounds in a way such that if all the bound values are equal but one is an upper bound and one is a lower bound, the upper bound is treated as smaller than the lower bound. This particular ordering is required by RelationBuildPartitionDesc() when building the PartitionBoundInfoData, so that it can consistently keep only the upper bounds when upper and lower bounds coincide. Update the function comment to make that clearer. Also, fix a (currently unreachable) corner-case bug -- if the bound values coincide and they contain unbounded values, fall through to the lower-vs-upper comparison code, rather than immediately returning 0. Currently it is not possible to define coincident upper and lower bounds containing unbounded columns, but that may change in the future, so code defensively.
