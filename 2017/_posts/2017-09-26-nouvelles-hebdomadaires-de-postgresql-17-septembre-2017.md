<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<p>Peter Eisentraut pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix DROP SUBSCRIPTION hang. When ALTER SUBSCRIPTION DISABLE is run in the same transaction before DROP SUBSCRIPTION, the latter will hang because workers will still be running, not having seen the DISABLE committed, and DROP SUBSCRIPTION will wait until the workers have vacated the replication origin slots. Previously, DROP SUBSCRIPTION killed the logical replication workers immediately only if it was going to drop the replication slot, otherwise it scheduled the worker killing for the end of the transaction, as a result of 7e174fa793a2df89fe03d002a5087ef67abcdde8. This, however, causes the present problem. To fix, kill the workers immediately in all cases. This covers all cases: A subscription that doesn't have a replication slot must be disabled. It was either disabled in the same transaction, or it was already disabled before the current transaction, but then there shouldn't be any workers left and this won't make a difference.

<li>pg_receivewal: Add --endpos option. This is primarily useful for making tests of this utility more deterministic, to avoid the complexity of starting pg_receivewal as a deamon in TAP tests. While this is less useful than the equivalent pg_recvlogical option, users can as well use it for example to enforce WAL streaming up to a end-of-backup position, to save only a minimal amount of WAL. Use this new option to stream WAL data in a deterministic way within a new set of TAP tests.

<li>Allow custom search filters to be configured for LDAP auth. Before, only filters of the form "(&lt;ldapsearchattribute&gt;=&lt;user&gt;)" could be used to search an LDAP server. Introduce ldapsearchfilter so that more general filters can be configured using patterns, like "(|(uid=$username)(mail=$username))" and "(&amp;(uid=$username) (objectClass=posixAccount))". Also allow search filters to be included in an LDAP URL.

<li>Define LDAP_NO_ATTRS if necessary. Commit 83aaac41c66959a3ebaec7daadc4885b5f98f561 introduced the use of LDAP_NO_ATTRS to avoid requesting a dummy attribute when doing search+bind LDAP authentication. It turns out that not all LDAP implementations define that macro, but its value is fixed by the protocol so we can define it ourselves if it's missing.

<li>Doc: update v10 release notes through today. Add item about number of times statement-level triggers will be fired. Rearrange the compatibility items into (what seems to me) a less random ordering. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/68ab9acd8557a9401a115a5369a14bf0a169e8e7">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/68ab9acd8557a9401a115a5369a14bf0a169e8e7</a></li>

<li>Fix possible dangling pointer dereference in trigger.c. AfterTriggerEndQuery correctly notes that the query_stack could get repalloc'd during a trigger firing, but it nonetheless passes the address of a query_stack entry to afterTriggerInvokeEvents, so that if such a repalloc occurs, afterTriggerInvokeEvents is already working with an obsolete dangling pointer while it scans the rest of the events. Oops. The only code at risk is its "delete_ok" cleanup code, so we can prevent unsafe behavior by passing delete_ok = false instead of true. However, that could have a significant performance penalty, because the point of passing delete_ok = true is to not have to re-scan possibly a large number of dead trigger events on the next time through the loop. There's more than one way to skin that cat, though. What we can do is delete all the "chunks" in the event list except the last one, since we know all events in them must be dead. Deleting the chunks is work we'd have had to do later in AfterTriggerEndQuery anyway, and it ends up saving rescanning of just about the same events we'd have gotten rid of with delete_ok = true. In v10 and HEAD, we also have to be careful to mop up any per-table after_trig_events pointers that would become dangling. This is slightly annoying, but I don't think that normal use-cases will traverse this code path often enough for it to be a performance problem. It's pretty hard to hit this in practice because of the unlikelihood of the query_stack getting resized at just the wrong time. Nonetheless, it's definitely a live bug of ancient standing, so back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Prefer argument name over "$n" for the refname of a plpgsql argument.

<li>Fix RecursiveCopy.pm to cope with disappearing files. When copying from an active database tree, it's possible for files to be deleted after we see them in a readdir() scan but before we can open them. (Once we've got a file open, we don't expect any further errors from it getting unlinked, though.) Tweak RecursiveCopy so it can cope with this case, so as to avoid irreproducible test failures.

<li>Distinguish selectivity of &lt; from &lt;= and &gt; from &gt;=. Historically, the selectivity functions have simply not distinguished &lt; from &lt;=, or &gt; from &gt;=, arguing that the fraction of the population that satisfies the "=" aspect can be considered to be vanishingly small, if the comparison value isn't any of the most-common-values for the variable. (If it is, the code path that executes the operator against each MCV will take care of things properly.) But that isn't really true unless we're dealing with a continuum of variable values, and in practice we seldom are. If "x = const" would estimate a nonzero number of rows for a given const value, then it follows that we ought to estimate different numbers of rows for "x &lt; const" and "x &lt;= const", even if the const is not one of the MCVs. Handling this more honestly makes a significant difference in edge cases, such as the estimate for a tight range (x BETWEEN y AND z where y and z are close together). Hence, split scalarltsel into scalarltsel/scalarlesel, and similarly split scalargtsel into scalargtsel/scalargesel. Adjust &lt;= and &gt;= operator definitions to reference the new selectivity functions. Improve the core ineq_histogram_selectivity() function to make a correction for equality. (Along the way, I learned quite a bit about exactly why that function gives good answers, which I tried to memorialize in improved comments.) The corresponding join selectivity functions were, and remain, just stubs. But I chose to split them similarly, to avoid confusion and to prevent the need for doing this exercise again if someone ever makes them less stubby. In passing, change ineq_histogram_selectivity's clamp for extreme probability estimates so that it varies depending on the histogram size, instead of being hardwired at 0.0001. With the default histogram size of 100 entries, you still get the old clamp value, but bigger histograms should allow us to put more faith in edge values.

<li>Don't use anonymous unions. Commit cc5f81366c36b3dd8f02bd9be1cf75b2cc8482bd introduced a language feature that is not acceptable to strict C89 compilers.

<li>Get rid of shared_record_typmod_registry_worker_detach; it doesn't work. This code is unsafe, as proven by buildfarm failures, because it tries to access shared memory that might already be gone. It's also unnecessary, because we're about to exit the process anyway and so the record type cache should never be accessed again. The idea was to lay some foundations for someday recycling workers --- which would require attaching to a different shared tupdesc registry --- but that will require considerably more thought. In the meantime let's save some bytes by just removing the nonfunctional code. Problem identification, and proposal to fix by removing functionality from the detach function, by Thomas Munro.

<li>Fix SQL-spec incompatibilities in new transition table feature. The standard says that all changes of the same kind (insert, update, or delete) caused in one table by a single SQL statement should be reported in a single transition table; and by that, they mean to include foreign key enforcement actions cascading from the statement's direct effects. It's also reasonable to conclude that if the standard had wCTEs, they would say that effects of wCTEs applying to the same table as each other or the outer statement should be merged into one transition table. We weren't doing it like that. Hence, arrange to merge tuples from multiple update actions into a single transition table as much as we can. There is a problem, which is that if the firing of FK enforcement triggers and after-row triggers with transition tables is interspersed, we might need to report more tuples after some triggers have already seen the transition table. It seems like a bad idea for the transition table to be mutable between trigger calls. There's no good way around this without a major redesign of the FK logic, so for now, resolve it by opening a new transition table each time this happens. Also, ensure that AFTER STATEMENT triggers fire just once per statement, or once per transition table when we're forced to make more than one. Previous versions of Postgres have allowed each FK enforcement query to cause an additional firing of the AFTER STATEMENT triggers for the referencing table, but that's certainly not per spec. (We're still doing multiple firings of BEFORE STATEMENT triggers, though; is that something worth changing?) Also, forbid using transition tables with column-specific UPDATE triggers. The spec requires such transition tables to show only the tuples for which the UPDATE trigger would have fired, which means maintaining multiple transition tables or else somehow filtering the contents at readout. Maybe someday we'll bother to support that option, but it looks like a lot of trouble for a marginal feature. The transition tables are now managed by the AfterTriggers data structures, rather than being directly the responsibility of ModifyTable nodes. This removes a subtransaction-lifespan memory leak introduced by my previous band-aid patch 3c4359521. In passing, refactor the AfterTriggers data structures to reduce the management overhead for them, by using arrays of structs rather than several parallel arrays for per-query-level and per-subtransaction state. I failed to resist the temptation to do some copy-editing on the SGML docs about triggers, above and beyond merely documenting the effects of this patch. Back-patch to v10, because we don't want the semantics of transition tables to change post-release. Patch by me, with help and review from Thomas Munro.

<li>Fix bogus size calculation introduced by commit cc5f81366. The elements of RecordCacheArray are TupleDesc, not TupleDesc *.

<li>Ensure that BEFORE STATEMENT triggers fire the right number of times. Commit 0f79440fb introduced mechanism to keep AFTER STATEMENT triggers from firing more than once per statement, which was formerly possible if more than one FK enforcement action had to be applied to a given table. Add a similar mechanism for BEFORE STATEMENT triggers, so that we don't have the unexpected situation of firing BEFORE STATEMENT triggers more often than AFTER STATEMENT. As with the previous patch, back-patch to v10.

<li>Add support for coordinating record typmods among parallel workers. Tuples can have type RECORDOID and a typmod number that identifies a blessed TupleDesc in a backend-private cache. To support the sharing of such tuples through shared memory and temporary files, provide a typmod registry in shared memory. To achieve that, introduce per-session DSM segments, created on demand when a backend first runs a parallel query. The per-session DSM segment has a table-of-contents just like the per-query DSM segment, and initially the contents are a shared record typmod registry and a DSA area to provide the space it needs to grow. State relating to the current session is accessed via a Session object reached through global variable CurrentSession that may require significant redesign further down the road as we figure out what else needs to be shared or remodelled.

<li>Fix ordering in pg_dump of GRANTs. The order in which GRANTs are output is important as GRANTs which have been GRANT'd by individuals via WITH GRANT OPTION GRANTs have to come after the GRANT which included the WITH GRANT OPTION. This happens naturally in the backend during normal operation as we only change existing ACLs in-place, only add new ACLs to the end, and when removing an ACL we remove any which depend on it also. Also, adjust the comments in acl.h to make this clear. Unfortunately, the updates to pg_dump to handle initial privileges involved pulling apart ACLs and then combining them back together and could end up putting them back together in an invalid order, leading to dumps which wouldn't restore. Fix this by adjusting the queries used by pg_dump to ensure that the ACLs are rebuilt in the same order in which they were originally.

<li>Expand partitioned table RTEs level by level, without flattening. Flattening the partitioning hierarchy at this stage makes various desirable optimizations difficult. The original use case for this patch was partition-wise join, which wants to match up the partitions in one partitioning hierarchy with those in another such hierarchy. However, it now seems that it will also be useful in making partition pruning work using the PartitionDesc rather than constraint exclusion, because with a flattened expansion, we have no easy way to figure out which PartitionDescs apply to which leaf tables in a multi-level partition hierarchy. As it turns out, we end up creating both rte-&gt;inh and !rte-&gt;inh RTEs for each intermediate partitioned table, just as we previously did for the root table. This seems unnecessary since the partitioned tables have no storage and are not scanned. We might want to go back and rejigger things so that no partitioned tables (including the parent) need !rte-&gt;inh RTEs, but that seems to require some adjustments not related to the core purpose of this patch.
