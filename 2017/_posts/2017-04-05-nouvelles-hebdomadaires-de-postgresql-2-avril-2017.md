<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<p>Tom Lane pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix unportable disregard of alignment requirements in RADIUS code. The compiler is entitled to store a char[] local variable with no particular alignment requirement. Our RADIUS code cavalierly took such a local variable and cast its address to a struct type that does have alignment requirements. On an alignment-picky machine this would lead to bus errors. To fix, declare the local variable honestly, and then cast its address to char * for use in the I/O calls. Given the lack of field complaints, there must be very few if any people affected; but nonetheless this is a clear portability issue, so back-patch to all supported branches. Noted while looking at a Coverity complaint in the same code. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4c051c41d63e8462971c13956a38030de9c35c51">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4c051c41d63e8462971c13956a38030de9c35c51</a></li>

<li>Fix some minor resource leaks in PerformRadiusTransaction(). Failure to free serveraddrs pointed out by Coverity, failure to close socket noted by code-reading. These bugs seem to be quite old, but given the low probability of taking these error-exit paths and the minimal consequences of the leaks (since the process would presumably exit shortly anyway), it doesn't seem worth back-patching. Michael Paquier and Tom Lane <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7cbd944662854a0a5264895bcba3ce7f9bfd1c1f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7cbd944662854a0a5264895bcba3ce7f9bfd1c1f</a></li>

<li>Fix typos in logical replication support for initial data copy. Fix an incorrect assert condition (noted by Coverity), and spell the new name of the function correctly. Typos introduced in commit 7c4f52409. Michael Paquier <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5459cfd3ad52b87a1e2ed293ae55e733c6964715">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5459cfd3ad52b87a1e2ed293ae55e733c6964715</a></li>

<li>Use ExecPrepareExpr in place of ExecPrepareCheck where appropriate. Change one more place where ExecInitCheck/ExecPrepareCheck's insistence on getting implicit-AND-format quals wasn't really helpful, because the caller had to do make_ands_implicit() for no reason that it cared about. Using ExecPrepareExpr directly simplifies the code and saves cycles. The only remaining use of these functions is to process resultRelInfo-&gt;ri_PartitionCheck quals. However, implicit-AND format does seem to be what we want for that, so leave it alone. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9b95f2fa1e2684fa209a3594db2254b8841bf380">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9b95f2fa1e2684fa209a3594db2254b8841bf380</a></li>

<li>Improve performance of ExecEvalWholeRowVar. In commit b8d7f053c, we needed to fix ExecEvalWholeRowVar to not change the state of the slot it's copying. The initial quick hack at that required two rounds of tuple construction, which is not very nice. To fix, add another primitive to tuptoaster.c that does precisely what we need. (I initially tried to do this by refactoring one of the existing functions into two pieces; but it looked like that might hurt performance for the existing case, and the amount of code that could be shared is not very large, so I gave up on that.)

<li>Show ignored constants as "$N" rather than "?" in pg_stat_statements. The trouble with the original choice here is that "?" is a valid (and indeed used) operator name, so that you could end up with ambiguous statement texts like "SELECT ? ? ?". With this patch, you instead see "SELECT $1 ? $2", which seems significantly more readable. The numbers used for this purpose begin after the last actual $N parameter in the particular query. The conflict with external parameters has its own potential for confusion of course, but it was agreed to be an improvement over the previous behavior.

<li>Suppress implicit-conversion warnings seen with newer clang versions. We were assigning values near 255 through "char *" pointers. On machines where char is signed, that's not entirely kosher, and it's reasonable for compilers to warn about it. A better solution would be to change the pointer type to "unsigned char *", but that would be vastly more invasive. For the moment, let's just apply this simple backpatchable solution.

<li>Make new expression eval code reject references to dropped columns. Formerly, a Var referencing an already-dropped column was allowed and would always produce a NULL value. However, that behavior was implemented in slot_getattr which the new expression code doesn't use; thus there is now a risk of returning theoretically-deleted data. We had regression test cases that purported to exercise this, but they failed to expose any problem, apparently because plpgsql filters the dropped column and produces an output tuple that has a NULL there already. Ideally the DROP or ALTER attempt in these test cases would get rejected due to dependency checks; but until that happens, let's modify the behavior so that we fail the query during executor start. This was already true for the related case of a column having changed type underneath us, and there's no obvious reason why we need to be laxer for dropped columns. In passing, adjust the error messages in CheckVarSlotCompatibility to include the composite type name. In the cases shown in the regression tests this is always just "record", but it should be more useful in actual stale-plan cases, where the slot tupdesc would be a table's tupdesc directly.

<li>Support \if ... \elif ... \else ... \endif in psql scripting. This patch adds nestable conditional blocks to psql. The control structure feature per se is complete, but the boolean expressions understood by \if and \elif are pretty primitive; basically, after variable substitution and backtick expansion, the result has to be "true" or "false" or one of the other standard spellings of a boolean value. But that's enough for many purposes, since you can always do the heavy lifting on the server side; and we can extend it later. Along the way, pay down some of the technical debt that had built up around psql/command.c: * Refactor exec_command() into a function per command, instead of being a 1500-line monstrosity. This makes the file noticeably longer because of repetitive function header/trailer overhead, but it seems much more readable. * Teach psql_get_variable() and psqlscanslash.l to suppress variable substitution and backtick expansion on the basis of the conditional stack state, thereby allowing removal of the OT_NO_EVAL kluge. * Fix the no-doubt-once-expedient hack of sometimes silently substituting mainloop.c's previous_buf for query_buf when calling HandleSlashCmds. (It's a bit remarkable that commands like \r worked at all with that.) Recall of a previous query is now done explicitly in the slash commands where that should happen. Corey Huinker, reviewed by Fabien Coelho, further hacking by me Discussion: <a target="_blank" href="https://postgr.es/m/CADkLM=c94OSRTnat=LX0ivNq4pxDNeoomFfYvBKM5N_xfmLtAA@mail.gmail.com">https://postgr.es/m/CADkLM=c94OSRTnat=LX0ivNq4pxDNeoomFfYvBKM5N_xfmLtAA@mail.gmail.com</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e984ef5861df4bc9733b36271d05763e82de7c04">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e984ef5861df4bc9733b36271d05763e82de7c04</a></li>

<li>Fix broken markup. Per buildfarm. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ab1e644005b6ef77dada51188d7b92905e2444d7">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ab1e644005b6ef77dada51188d7b92905e2444d7</a></li>

<li>For foreign keys, check REFERENCES privilege only on the referenced table. We were requiring that the user have REFERENCES permission on both the referenced and referencing tables --- but this doesn't seem to have any support in the SQL standard, which says only that you need REFERENCES permission on the referenced table. And ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY has already checked that you own the referencing table, so the check could only fail if a table owner has revoked his own REFERENCES permission. Moreover, the symmetric interpretation of this permission is unintuitive and confusing, as per complaint from Paul Jungwirth. So let's drop the referencing-side check. In passing, do a bit of wordsmithing on the GRANT reference page so that all the privilege types are described in similar fashion.

<li>Fix unstable regression test result. Commit e306df7f9 added a test case that depends on "the" being a stop word, which it is not in non-English locales. Since the point of the test is to check stopword behavior, fix by forcibly selecting the 'english' configuration. Per buildfarm. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f1a285e21111f4d4d0c3f428ce2b3ae9e7f162c2">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f1a285e21111f4d4d0c3f428ce2b3ae9e7f162c2</a></li>

<li>Fix unstable regression test result. Whoops, missed that same test was made for json as well as jsonb. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c281cd5fe178c946dc23eae4d4642be5ddbe3eb4">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c281cd5fe178c946dc23eae4d4642be5ddbe3eb4</a></li>

<li>Allow psql variable substitution to occur in backtick command strings. Previously, text between backquotes in a psql metacommand's arguments was always passed to the shell literally. That considerably hobbles the usefulness of the feature for scripting, so we'd foreseen for a long time that we'd someday want to allow substitution of psql variables into the shell command. IMO the addition of \if metacommands has brought us to that point, since \if can greatly benefit from some sort of client-side expression evaluation capability, and psql itself is not going to grow any such thing in time for v10. Hence, this patch. It allows :VARIABLE to be replaced by the exact contents of the named variable, while :'VARIABLE' is replaced by the variable's contents suitably quoted to become a single shell-command argument. (The quoting rules for that are different from those for SQL literals, so this is a bit of an abuse of the :'VARIABLE' notation, but I doubt anyone will be confused.) As with other situations in psql, no substitution occurs if the word following a colon is not a known variable name. That limits the risk of compatibility problems for existing psql scripts; but the risk isn't zero, so this needs to be called out in the v10 release notes.

<li>Fix behavior of psql's \p to agree with \g, \w, etc. In commit e984ef586 I (tgl) simplified the behavior of \p to just print the current query buffer; but Daniel V&Atilde;&copy;rit&Atilde;&copy; points out that this made it inconsistent with the behavior of \g and \w.

<li>Change default of log_directory to 'log'. The previous default 'pg_log' might have indicated by its "pg_" prefix that it is an internal system directory. The new default is more in line with the typical naming of directories with user-facing log files. Together with the renaming of pg_clog and pg_xlog, this should clear up that difference.

Instead of plan = plpy.prepare(...) res = plpy.execute(plan, ...) you can now write plan = plpy.prepare(...) res = plan.execute(...) or even res = plpy.prepare(...).execute(...) and similarly for the cursor() method.

<li>Cast result of copyObject() to correct type. copyObject() is declared to return void *, which allows easily assigning the result independent of the input, but it loses all type checking. If the compiler supports typeof or something similar, cast the result to the input type. This creates a greater amount of type safety. In some cases, where the result is assigned to a generic type such as Node * or Expr *, new casts are now necessary, but in general casts are now unnecessary in the normal case and indicate that something unusual is happening.

<li>Show more processes in pg_stat_activity. Previously, auxiliary processes and background workers not connected to a database (such as the logical replication launcher) weren't shown. Include them, so that we can see the associated wait state information. Add a new column to identify the processes type, so that people can filter them out easily using SQL if they wish. Before this patch was written, there was discussion about whether we should expose this information in a separate view, so as to avoid contaminating pg_stat_activity with things people might not want to see. But putting everything in pg_stat_activity was a more popular choice, so that's what the patch does. Kuntal Ghosh, reviewed by Amit Langote and Michael Paquier. Some revisions and bug fixes by me.

<li>Don't allocate storage for partitioned tables. Also, don't allow setting reloptions on them, since that would have no effect given the lack of storage. The patch does this by introducing a new reloption kind for which there are currently no reloptions -- we might have some in the future -- so it adjusts parseRelOptions to handle that case correctly. Bumped catversion. System catalogs that contained reloptions for partitioned tables are no longer valid; plus, there are now fewer physical files on disk, which is not technically a catalog change but still a good reason to re-initdb.

<li>Revert "Allow ON CONFLICT .. DO NOTHING on a partitioned table.". This reverts commit 8355a011a0124bdf7ccbada206a967d427039553, which turns out to have been a misguided effort. We can't really support this in a partitioning hierarchy after all for exactly the reasons stated in the documentation removed by that commit. It's still possible to use ON CONFLICT .. DO NOTHING (or for that matter ON CONFLICT .. DO UPDATE) on individual partitions if desired, but but to allow this on a partitioned table implies that we have some way of evaluating uniqueness across the whole partitioning hierarchy, which is false. Shinoda Noriyoshi noticed that the old code was crashing (which we could fix, though not in a nice way) and Amit Langote realized that this was indicative of a fundamental problem with the commit being reverted here.

<li>Don't use bgw_main even to specify in-core bgworker entrypoints. On EXEC_BACKEND builds, this can fail if ASLR is in use. Backpatch to 9.5. On master, completely remove the bgw_main field completely, since there is no situation in which it is safe for an EXEC_BACKEND build. On 9.6 and 9.5, leave the field intact to avoid breaking things for third-party code that doesn't care about working under EXEC_BACKEND. Prior to 9.5, there are no in-core bgworker entrypoints.

<li>Fix parallel query so it doesn't spoil row estimates above Gather. Commit 45be99f8cd5d606086e0a458c9c72910ba8a613d removed GatherPath's num_workers field, but this is entirely bogus. Normally, a path's parallel_workers flag is supposed to indicate the number of workers that it wants, and should be 0 for a non-partial path. In that commit, I mistakenly thought that GatherPath could also use that field to indicate the number of workers that it would try to start, but that's disastrous, because then it can propagate up to higher nodes in the plan tree, which will then get incorrect rowcounts because the parallel_workers flag is involved in computing those values. Repair by putting the separate field back. Report by Tomas Vondra. Patch by me, reviewed by Amit Kapila.

This extends the Aggregate node with two new features: HashAggregate can now run multiple hashtables concurrently, and a new strategy MixedAggregate populates hashtables while doing sorted grouping. The planner will now attempt to save as many sorts as possible when planning grouping sets queries, while not exceeding work_mem for the estimated combined sizes of all hashtables used.

The code for the reworked n-distinct estimation on commit 7b504eb282 was written differently in a previous version of the patch, prior to commit; on rewriting it, we missed updating an initializer.

<li>Remove direct uses of ItemPointer.{ip_blkid,ip_posid}. There are no functional changes here; this simply encapsulates knowledge of the ItemPointerData struct so that a future patch can change things without more breakage. All direct users of ip_blkid and ip_posid are changed to use existing macros ItemPointerGetBlockNumber and ItemPointerGetOffsetNumber respectively. For callers where that's inappropriate (because they Assert that the itempointer is is valid-looking), add ItemPointerGetBlockNumberNoCheck and ItemPointerGetOffsetNumberNoCheck, which lack the assertion but are otherwise identical.

<li>Allow DSM segments to be created as pinned. dsm_create and dsm_attach assumed that a current resource owner was always in place. Exploration with the API show that this is inconvenient: sometimes one must create a dummy resowner, create/attach the DSM, only to pin the mapping later, which is wasteful. Change create/attach so that if there is no current resowner, the dsm is effectively pinned right from the start.

<li>Simplify check of modified attributes in heap_update. The old coding was getting more complicated as new things were added, and it would be barely tolerable with upcoming WARM updates and other future features such as indirect indexes. The new coding incurs a small performance cost in synthetic benchmark cases, and is barely measurable in normal cases. A much larger benefit is expected from WARM, which could actually bolt its needs on top of the existing coding, but it is much uglier and bug-prone than doing it on this new code. Additional optimization can be applied on top of this, if need be.

<li>BRIN de-summarization. When the BRIN summary tuple for a page range becomes too "wide" for the values actually stored in the table (because the tuples that were present originally are no longer present due to updates or deletes), it can be useful to remove the outdated summary tuple, so that a future summarization can install a tighter summary. This commit introduces a SQL-callable interface to do so.

<li>BRIN auto-summarization. Previously, only VACUUM would cause a page range to get initially summarized by BRIN indexes, which for some use cases takes too much time since the inserts occur. To avoid the delay, have brininsert request a summarization run for the previous range as soon as the first tuple is inserted into the first page of the next range. Autovacuum is in charge of processing these requests, after doing all the regular vacuuming/ analyzing work on tables. This doesn't impose any new tasks on autovacuum, because autovacuum was already in charge of doing summarizations. The only actual effect is to change the timing, i.e. that it occurs earlier. For this reason, we don't go any great lengths to record these requests very robustly; if they are lost because of a server crash or restart, they will happen at a later time anyway. Most of the new code here is in autovacuum, which can now be told about "work items" to process. This can be used for other things such as GIN pending list cleaning, perhaps visibility map bit setting, both of which are currently invoked during vacuum, but do not really depend on vacuum taking place. The requests are at the page range level, a granularity for which we did not have SQL-level access; we only had index-level summarization requests via brin_summarize_new_values(). It seems reasonable to add SQL-level access to range-level summarization too, so add a function brin_summarize_range() to do that. Authors: &Atilde;lvaro Herrera, based on sketch from Simon Riggs.

<li>Simplify the example of VACUUM in documentation. Previously a detailed activity report by VACUUM VERBOSE ANALYZE was described as an example of VACUUM in docs.

So basically we need to update the example.

<li>Add infrastructure to support EphemeralNamedRelation references. A QueryEnvironment concept is added, which allows new types of objects to be passed into queries from parsing on through execution. At this point, the only thing implemented is a collection of EphemeralNamedRelation objects -- relations which can be referenced by name in queries, but do not exist in the catalogs. The only type of ENR implemented is NamedTuplestore, but provision is made to add more types fairly easily. An ENR can carry its own TupleDesc or reference a relation in the catalogs by relid. Although these features can be used without SPI, convenience functions are added to SPI so that ENRs can easily be used by code run through SPI. The initial use of all this is going to be transition tables in AFTER triggers, but that will be added to each PL as a separate commit. An incidental effect of this patch is to produce a more informative error message if an attempt is made to modify the contents of a CTE from a referencing DML statement.
