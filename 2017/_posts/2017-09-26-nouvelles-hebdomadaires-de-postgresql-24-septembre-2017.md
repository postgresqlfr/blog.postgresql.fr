<li>Add basic TAP test setup for pg_upgrade. The plan is to convert the current pg_upgrade test to the TAP framework. This commit just puts a basic TAP test in place so that we can see how the build farm behaves, since the build farm client has some special knowledge of the pg_upgrade tests. Author: Michael Paquier &lt;michael.paquier@gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f41e56c76e39f02bef7ba002c9de03d62b76de4d">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f41e56c76e39f02bef7ba002c9de03d62b76de4d</a></li>

<li>Fix build with !USE_WIDE_UPPER_LOWER. The placement of the ifdef blocks in formatting.c was pretty bogus, so the code failed to compile if USE_WIDE_UPPER_LOWER was not defined. Reported-by: Peter Geoghegan &lt;pg@bowt.ie&gt; Reported-by: Noah Misch &lt;noah@leadboat.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e6023ee7fa73a2d9a2d7524f63584844b2291def">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e6023ee7fa73a2d9a2d7524f63584844b2291def</a></li>

<li>Remove contrib/chkpass. The recent addition of a test suite for this module revealed a few problems. It uses a crypt() method that is no longer considered secure and doesn't work anymore on some platforms. Using a volatile input function violates internal sanity check assumptions and leads to failures on the build farm. So this module is neither a usable security tool nor a good example for an extension. No one wanted to argue for keeping or improving it, so remove it.

<li>doc: Document commands that cannot be run in a transaction block. Mainly covering the new CREATE SUBSCRIPTION and DROP SUBSCRIPTION, but ALTER DATABASE SET TABLESPACE was also missing. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/91ad8b416cee753eaa6f520ee2d21c2d41853381">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/91ad8b416cee753eaa6f520ee2d21c2d41853381</a></li>

<li>Revert "Add basic TAP test setup for pg_upgrade". This reverts commit f41e56c76e39f02bef7ba002c9de03d62b76de4d. The build farm client would run the pg_upgrade tests twice, once as part of the existing pg_upgrade check run and once as part of picking up all TAP tests by looking for "t" directories. Since the pg_upgrade tests are pretty slow, we will need a better solution or possibly a build farm client change before we can proceed with this. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/58ffe141eb37c3f027acd25c1fc6b36513bf9380">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/58ffe141eb37c3f027acd25c1fc6b36513bf9380</a></li>

<li>Fix saving and restoring umask. In two cases, we set a different umask for some piece of code and restore it afterwards. But if the contained code errors out, the umask is not restored. So add TRY/CATCH blocks to fix that. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/aa6b7b72d9bcf967cbccd378de4bc5cef33d02f9">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/aa6b7b72d9bcf967cbccd378de4bc5cef33d02f9</a></li>

<li>Refactor new file permission handling. The file handling functions from fd.c were called with a diverse mix of notations for the file permissions when they were opening new files. Almost all files created by the server should have the same permissions set. So change the API so that e.g. OpenTransientFile() automatically uses the standard permissions set, and OpenTransientFilePerm() is a new function that takes an explicit permissions set for the few cases where it is needed. This also saves an unnecessary argument for call sites that are just opening an existing file. While we're reviewing these APIs, get rid of the FileName typedef and use the standard const char * for the file name and mode_t for the file mode. This makes these functions match other file handling functions and removes an unnecessary layer of mysteriousness. We can also get rid of a few casts that way.

<li>Fix pg_basebackup test to original intent. One test case was meant to check that pg_basebackup does not succeed when a slot is specified with -S but WAL streaming is not selected, which used to require specifying -X stream. Since -X stream is the default in PostgreSQL 10, this test case no longer covers that meaning, but the pg_basebackup invocation happened to fail anyway for the unrelated reason that the specified replication slot does not exist. To fix, move the test case to later in the file where the slot does exist, and add -X none to the invocation so that it covers the originally meant behavior. extracted from a patch by Michael Banck &lt;michael.banck@credativ.de&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/74ca8f9b9077017529fe658e445a11da296ac6ab">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/74ca8f9b9077017529fe658e445a11da296ac6ab</a></li>

<li>doc: Expand user documentation on SCRAM. Explain more about how the different password authentication methods and the password_encryption settings relate to each other, give some upgrading advice, and set a better link from the release notes.

<li>Allow ICU to use SortSupport on Windows with UTF-8. There is no reason to ever prevent the use of SortSupport on Windows when ICU locales are used. We previously avoided SortSupport on Windows with UTF-8 server encoding and a non C-locale due to restrictions in Windows' libc functionality. This is now considered to be a restriction in one platform's libc collation provider, and not a more general platform restriction.

<li>Fix, or at least ameliorate, bugs in logicalrep_worker_launch(). If we failed to get a background worker slot, the code just walked away from the logicalrep-worker slot it already had, leaving that looking like the worker is still starting up. This led to an indefinite hang in subscription startup, as reported by Thomas Munro. We must release the slot on failure. Also fix a thinko: we must capture the worker slot's generation before releasing LogicalRepWorkerLock the first time, else testing to see if it's changed is pretty meaningless. BTW, the CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() in WaitForReplicationWorkerAttach is a ticking time bomb, even without considering the possibility of elog(ERROR) in one of the other functions it calls. Really, this entire business needs a redesign with some actual thought about error recovery. But for now I'm just band-aiding the case observed in testing. Back-patch to v10 where this code was added.

<li>Make DatumGetFoo/PG_GETARG_FOO/PG_RETURN_FOO macro names more consistent. By project convention, these names should include "P" when dealing with a pointer type; that is, if the result of a GETARG macro is of type FOO *, it should be called PG_GETARG_FOO_P not just PG_GETARG_FOO. Some newer types such as JSONB and ranges had not followed the convention, and a number of contrib modules hadn't gotten that memo either. Rename the offending macros to improve consistency. In passing, fix a few places that thought PG_DETOAST_DATUM() returns a Datum; it does not, it returns "struct varlena *". Applying DatumGetPointer to that happens not to cause any bad effects today, but it's formally wrong. Also, adjust an ltree macro that was designed without any thought for what pgindent would do with it. This is all cosmetic and shouldn't have any impact on generated code.

<li>Minor code-cleanliness improvements for btree. Make the btree page-flags test macros (P_ISLEAF and friends) return clean boolean values, rather than values that might not fit in a bool. Use them in a few places that were randomly referencing the flag bits directly. In passing, change access/nbtree/'s only direct use of BUFFER_LOCK_SHARE to BT_READ. (Some think we should go the other way, but as long as we have BT_READ/BT_WRITE, let's use them consistently.)

<li>Remove no-op GiST support functions in the core GiST opclasses. The preceding patch allowed us to remove useless GiST support functions. This patch actually does that for all the no-op cases in the core GiST code. This buys us whatever performance gain is to be had, and more importantly exercises the preceding patch. There remain no-op functions in the contrib GiST opclasses, but those will take more work to remove.

<li>Allow no-op GiST support functions to be omitted. There are common use-cases in which the compress and/or decompress functions can be omitted, with the result being that we make no data transformation when storing or retrieving index values. Previously, you had to provide a no-op function anyway, but this patch allows such opclass support functions to be omitted. Furthermore, if the compress function is omitted, then the core code knows that the stored representation is the same as the original data. This means we can allow index-only scans without requiring a fetch function to be provided either. Previously you had to provide a no-op fetch function if you wanted IOS to work. This reportedly provides a small performance benefit in such cases, but IMO the real reason for doing it is just to reduce the amount of useless boilerplate code that has to be written for GiST opclasses.

<li>Fix erroneous documentation about noise word GROUP. GRANT, REVOKE, and some allied commands allow the noise word GROUP before a role name (cf. grantee production in gram.y). This option does not exist elsewhere, but it had nonetheless snuck into the documentation for ALTER ROLE, ALTER USER, and CREATE SCHEMA. Seems to be a copy-and-pasteo in commit 31eae6028, which did expand the syntax choices here, but not in that way. Back-patch to 9.5 where that came in.

<li>Fix instability in subscription regression test. 005_encoding.pl neglected to wait for the subscriber's initial synchronization to happen. While we have not seen this fail in the buildfarm, it's pretty easy to demonstrate there's an issue by hacking logicalrep_worker_launch() to fail most of the time.

<li>Improve dubious memory management in pg_newlocale_from_collation(). pg_newlocale_from_collation() used malloc() and strdup() directly, which is generally not per backend coding style, and it didn't bother to check for failure results, but would just SIGSEGV instead. Also, if one of the numerous error checks in the middle of the function failed, the already-allocated memory would be leaked permanently. Admittedly, it's not a lot of memory, but it could build up if this function were called repeatedly for a bad collation. The first two problems are easily cured by palloc'ing in TopMemoryContext instead of calling libc directly. We can fairly easily dodge the leakage problem for the struct pg_locale_struct by filling in a temporary variable and allocating permanent storage only once we reach the bottom of the function. It's harder to get rid of the potential leakage for ICU's copy of the collcollate string, but at least that's only allocated after most of the error checks; so live with that aspect. Back-patch to v10 where this code came in, with one or another of the ICU patches. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7b86c2ac9563ffd9b870cfd73a769431b7922e81">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7b86c2ac9563ffd9b870cfd73a769431b7922e81</a></li>

<li>Give a better error for duplicate entries in VACUUM/ANALYZE column list. Previously, the code didn't think about this case and would just try to analyze such a column twice. That would fail at the point of inserting the second version of the pg_statistic row, with obscure error messsages like "duplicate key value violates unique constraint" or "tuple already updated by self", depending on context and PG version. We could allow the case by ignoring duplicate column specifications, but it seems better to reject it explicitly. The bogus error messages seem like arguably a bug, so back-patch to all supported versions. Nathan Bossart, per a report from Michael Paquier, and whacked around a bit by me.

<li>Revert "Fix bool/int type confusion". This reverts commit 0ec2e908babfbfde83a3925680f06b16408739ff.

<li>Sync our copy of the timezone library with IANA tzcode master. This patch absorbs a few unreleased fixes in the IANA code. It corresponds to commit 2d8b944c1cec0808ac4f7a9ee1a463c28f9cd00a in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eggert/tz.">https://github.com/eggert/tz.</a> Non-cosmetic changes include: TZDEFRULESTRING is updated to match current US DST practice, rather than what it was over ten years ago. This only matters for interpretation of POSIX-style zone names (e.g., "EST5EDT"), and only if the timezone database doesn't include either an exact match for the zone name or a "posixrules" entry. The latter should not be true in any current Postgres installation, but this could possibly matter when using --with-system-tzdata. Get rid of a nonportable use of "++var" on a bool var. This is part of a larger fix that eliminates some vestigial support for consecutive leap seconds, and adds checks to the "zic" compiler that the data files do not specify that. Remove a couple of ancient compatibility hacks. The IANA crew think these are obsolete, and I tend to agree. But perhaps our buildfarm will think different. Back-patch to all supported branches, in line with our policy that all branches should be using current IANA code. Before v10, this includes application of current pgindent rules, to avoid whitespace problems in future back-patches.

<li>Assume wcstombs(), towlower(), and sibling functions are always present. These functions are required by SUS v2, which is our minimum baseline for Unix platforms, and are present on all interesting Windows versions as well. Even our oldest buildfarm members have them. Thus, we were not testing the "!USE_WIDE_UPPER_LOWER" code paths, which explains why the bug fixed in commit e6023ee7f escaped detection. Per discussion, there seems to be no more real-world value in maintaining this option. Hence, remove the configure-time tests for wcstombs() and towlower(), remove the USE_WIDE_UPPER_LOWER symbol, and remove all the !USE_WIDE_UPPER_LOWER code. There's not actually all that much of the latter, but simplifying the #if nests is a win in itself.

<li>Mop-up for commit 85feb77aa09cda9ff3e12cf95c757c499dc25343.

<li>Allow up to 3 "-P 1" reports per thread in pgbench run of 2 seconds. There seems to be some considerable imprecision in the timing of -P progress reports. Nominally each thread ought to produce 2 reports in this test, but about 10% of the time we only get one, and 1% of the time we get three, as per buildfarm results so far. Pending further investigation, treat the last case as a "pass". (I, tgl, am suspicious that this still might not be lax enough, now that it's obvious that the behavior is load-dependent; but there's not yet buildfarm evidence to confirm that suspicion.)

<li>Improve memory management in autovacuum.c. Invoke vacuum(), as well as "work item" processing, in the PortalContext that do_autovacuum() has manufactured, which will be reset before each such invocation. This ensures cleanup of any memory leaked by these operations. It also avoids the rather dangerous practice of calling vacuum() in a context that vacuum() itself will destroy while it runs. There's no known live bug there, but it's not hard to imagine introducing one if we leave it like this.

<li>Fix crash restart bug introduced in 8356753c212. The bug was caused by not re-reading the control file during crash recovery restarts, which lead to an attempt to pfree() shared memory contents. The fix is to re-read the control file, which seems good anyway. It's unclear as of this moment, whether we want to keep the refactoring introduced in the commit referenced above, or come up with an alternative approach. But fixing the bug in the mean time seems like a good idea regardless. A followup commit will introduce regression test coverage for crash restarts.

<li>Rearm statement_timeout after each executed query. Previously statement_timeout, in the extended protocol, affected all messages till a Sync message. For clients that pipeline/batch query execution that's problematic. Instead disable timeout after each Execute message, and enable, if necessary, the timer in start_xact_command(). As that's done only for Execute and not Parse / Bind, pipelining the latter two could still cause undesirable timeouts. But a survey of protocol implementations shows that all drivers issue Sync messages when preparing, and adding timeout rearming to both is fairly expensive for the common parse / bind / execute sequence.

Previously multi-byte aware truncation was done on every pgstat_report_activity() call - proving to be a bottleneck for workloads with long query strings that execute quickly. Instead move the truncation to the read side, which commonly is executed far less frequently. That's possible because all server encodings allow to determine the length of a multi-byte string from the first byte.

<li>Make WAL segment size configurable at initdb time. For performance reasons a larger segment size than the default 16MB can be useful. A larger segment size has two main benefits: Firstly, in setups using archiving, it makes it easier to write scripts that can keep up with higher amounts of WAL, secondly, the WAL has to be written and synced to disk less frequently. But at the same time large segment size are disadvantageous for smaller databases. So far the segment size had to be configured at compile time, often making it unrealistic to choose one fitting to a particularly load. Therefore change it to a initdb time setting. This includes a breaking changes to the xlogreader.h API, which now requires the current segment size to be configured. For that and similar reasons a number of binaries had to be taught how to recognize the current segment size.

<li>Associate partitioning information with each RelOptInfo. This is not used for anything yet, but it is necessary infrastructure for partition-wise join and for partition pruning without constraint exclusion. Ashutosh Bapat, reviewed by Amit Langote and with quite a few changes, mostly cosmetic, by me. Additional review and testing of this patch series by Antonin Houska, Amit Khandekar, Rafia Sabih, Rajkumar Raghuwanshi, Thomas Munro, and Dilip Kumar.

<li>hash: Implement page-at-a-time scan. Commit 09cb5c0e7d6fbc9dee26dc429e4fc0f2a88e5272 added a similar optimization to btree back in 2006, but nobody bothered to implement the same thing for hash indexes, probably because they weren't WAL-logged and had lots of other performance problems as well. As with the corresponding btree case, this eliminates the problem of potentially needing to refind our position within the page, and cuts down on pin/unpin traffic as well. Ashutosh Sharma, reviewed by Alexander Korotkov, Jesper Pedersen, Amit Kapila, and me. Some final edits to comments and README by me.
