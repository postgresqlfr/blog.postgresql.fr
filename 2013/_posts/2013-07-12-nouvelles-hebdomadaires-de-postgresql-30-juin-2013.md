<li>Support clean switchover. In replication, when we shutdown the master, walsender tries to send all the outstanding WAL records to the standby, and then to exit. This basically means that all the WAL records are fully synced between two servers after the clean shutdown of the master. So, after promoting the standby to new master, we can restart the stopped master as new standby without the need for a fresh backup from new master. But there was one problem so far: though walsender tries to send all the outstanding WAL records, it doesn't wait for them to be replicated to the standby. Then, before receiving all the WAL records, walreceiver can detect the closure of connection and exit. We cannot guarantee that there is no missing WAL in the standby after clean shutdown of the master. In this case, backup from new master is required when restarting the stopped master as new standby. This patch fixes this problem. It just changes walsender so that it waits for all the outstanding WAL records to be replicated to the standby before closing the replication connection. Per discussion, this is a fix that needs to get backpatched rather than new feature. So, back-patch to 9.1 where enough infrastructure for this exists. Patch by me, reviewed by Andres Freund.

<li>Properly dump dropped foreign table cols in binary-upgrade mode. In binary upgrade mode, we need to recreate and then drop dropped columns so that all the columns get the right attribute number. This is true for foreign tables as well as for native tables. For foreign tables we have been getting the first part right but not the second, leading to bogus columns in the upgraded database. Fix this all the way back to 9.1, where foreign tables were introduced.

<li>Avoid inconsistent type declaration. Clang 3.3 correctly complains that a variable of type enum MultiXactStatus cannot hold a value of -1, which makes sense. Change the declared type of the variable to int instead, and apply casting as necessary to avoid the warning. Per notice from Andres Freund

<li>Send SIGKILL to children if they don't die quickly in immediate shutdown. On immediate shutdown, or during a restart-after-crash sequence, postmaster used to send SIGQUIT (and then abandon ship if shutdown); but this is not a good strategy if backends don't die because of that signal. (This might happen, for example, if a backend gets tangled trying to malloc() due to gettext(), as in an example illustrated by MauMau.) This causes problems when later trying to restart the server, because some processes are still attached to the shared memory segment. Instead of just abandoning such backends to their fates, we now have postmaster hang around for a little while longer, send a SIGKILL after some reasonable waiting period, and then exit. This makes immediate shutdown more reliable. There is disagreement on whether it's best for postmaster to exit after sending SIGKILL, or to stick around until all children have reported death. If this controversy is resolved differently than what this patch implements, it's an easy change to make. Bug reported by MauMau in message 20DAEA8949EC4E2289C6E8E58560DEC0@maumau MauMau and &Aacute;lvaro Herrera

<li>Renovate display of non-ASCII messages on Windows. GNU gettext selects a default encoding for the messages it emits in a platform-specific manner; it uses the Windows ANSI code page on Windows and follows LC_CTYPE on other platforms. This is inconvenient for PostgreSQL server processes, so realize consistent cross-platform behavior by calling bind_textdomain_codeset() on Windows each time we permanently change LC_CTYPE. This primarily affects SQL_ASCII databases and processes like the postmaster that do not attach to a database, making their behavior consistent with PostgreSQL on non-Windows platforms. Messages from SQL_ASCII databases use the encoding implied by the database LC_CTYPE, and messages from non-database processes use LC_CTYPE from the postmaster system environment. PlatformEncoding becomes unused, so remove it. Make write_console() prefer WriteConsoleW() to write() regardless of the encodings in use. In this situation, write() will invariably mishandle non-ASCII characters. elog.c has assumed that messages conform to the database encoding. While usually true, this does not hold for SQL_ASCII and MULE_INTERNAL. Introduce MessageEncoding to track the actual encoding of message text. The present consumers are Windows-specific code for converting messages to UTF16 for use in system interfaces. This fixes the appearance in Windows event logs and consoles of translated messages from SQL_ASCII processes like the postmaster. Note that SQL_ASCII inherently disclaims a strong notion of encoding, so non-ASCII byte sequences interpolated into messages by %s may yet yield a nonsensical message. MULE_INTERNAL has similar problems at present, albeit for a different reason: its lack of libiconv support or a conversion to UTF8. Consequently, one need no longer restart Windows with a different Windows ANSI code page to broadly test backend logging under a given language. Changing the user's locale ("Format") is enough. Several accounts can simultaneously run postmasters under different locales, all correctly logging localized messages to Windows event logs and consoles. Alexander Law and Noah Misch

<li>Initialize pad bytes in GinFormTuple(). Every other core buffer page consumer initializes the bytes it furnishes to PageAddItem(). For consistency, do the same here. No back-patch; regardless, we couldn't count on the fix so long as binary upgrade can carry forward affected index builds.

<li>Cooperate with the Valgrind instrumentation framework. Valgrind "client requests" in aset.c and mcxt.c teach Valgrind and its Memcheck tool about the PostgreSQL allocator. This makes Valgrind roughly as sensitive to memory errors involving palloc chunks as it is to memory errors involving malloc chunks. Further client requests in PageAddItem() and printtup() verify that all bits being added to a buffer page or furnished to an output function are predictably-defined. Those tests catch failures of C-language functions to fully initialize the bits of a Datum, which in turn stymie optimizations that rely on _equalConst(). Define the USE_VALGRIND symbol in pg_config_manual.h to enable these additions. An included "suppression file" silences nominal errors we don't plan to fix. Reviewed in earlier versions by Peter Geoghegan and Korry Douglas.

<li>Refactor aset.c and mcxt.c in preparation for Valgrind cooperation. Move some repeated debugging code into functions and store intermediates in variables where not presently necessary. No code-generation changes in a production build, and no functional changes. This simplifies and focuses the main patch.

<li>Permit super-MaxAllocSize allocations with MemoryContextAllocHuge(). The MaxAllocSize guard is convenient for most callers, because it reduces the need for careful attention to overflow, data type selection, and the SET_VARSIZE() limit. A handful of callers are happy to navigate those hazards in exchange for the ability to allocate a larger chunk. Introduce MemoryContextAllocHuge() and repalloc_huge(). Use this in tuplesort.c and tuplestore.c, enabling internal sorts of up to INT_MAX tuples, a factor-of-48 increase. In particular, B-tree index builds can now benefit from much-larger maintenance_work_mem settings. Reviewed by Stephen Frost, Simon Riggs and Jeff Janes.

<li>Make the OVER keyword unreserved. This results in a slightly less specific error message when OVER is used in a context where we don't accept window functions, but per discussion, it's worth it to get the benefit of not needing to reserve this keyword any more.

<li>Tweak wording in sequence-function docs to avoid PDF build failures. Adjust the wording in the first para of "Sequence Manipulation Functions" so that neither of the link phrases in it break across line boundaries, in either A4- or US-page-size PDF output. This fixes a reported build failure for the 9.3beta2 A4 PDF docs, and future-proofs this particular para against causing similar problems in future. (Perhaps somebody will fix this issue in the SGML/TeX documentation tool chain someday, but I'm not holding my breath.) Back-patch to all supported branches, since the same problem could rise up to bite us in future updates if anyone changes anything earlier than this in func.sgml.

<li>Expect EWOULDBLOCK from a non-blocking connect() call only on Windows. On Unix-ish platforms, EWOULDBLOCK may be the same as EAGAIN, which is *not* a success return, at least not on Linux. We need to treat it as a failure to avoid giving a misleading error message. Per the Single Unix Spec, only EINPROGRESS and EINTR returns indicate that the connection attempt is in progress. On Windows, on the other hand, EWOULDBLOCK (WSAEWOULDBLOCK) is the expected case. We must accept EINPROGRESS as well because Cygwin will return that, and it doesn't seem worth distinguishing Cygwin from native Windows here. It's not very clear whether EINTR can occur on Windows, but let's leave that part of the logic alone in the absence of concrete trouble reports. Also, remove the test for errno == 0, effectively reverting commit da9501bddb42222dc33c031b1db6ce2133bcee7b, which AFAICS was just a thinko; or at best it might have been a workaround for a platform-specific bug, which we can hope is gone now thirteen years later. In any case, since libpq makes no effort to reset errno to zero before calling connect(), it seems unlikely that that test has ever reliably done anything useful. Andres Freund and Tom Lane

<li>Mark index-constraint comments with correct dependency in pg_dump. When there's a comment on an index that was created with UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint syntax, we need to label the comment as depending on the constraint not the index, since only the constraint object actually appears in the dump. This incorrect dependency can lead to parallel pg_restore trying to restore the comment before the index has been created, per bug #8257 from Lloyd Albin. This patch fixes pg_dump to produce the right dependency in dumps made in the future. Usually we also try to hack pg_restore to work around bogus dependencies, so that existing (wrong) dumps can still be restored in parallel mode; but that doesn't seem practical here since there's no easy way to relate the constraint dump entry to the comment after the fact.

<li>Track spinlock delay in microsecond granularity. On many platforms the OS will round the sleep time to millisecond resolution, but there is no reason for us to pre-emptively round the argument to pg_usleep. When the delay was measured in milliseconds and started from 1 ms, it sometimes took many attempts until the logic that increases the delay by multiplying with a random value between 1 and 2 actually managed to bump it from 1 ms to 2 ms. That lead to a sequence of 1 ms waits until the delay started to increase. This wasn't really a problem but it looked odd if you observed the waits. There is no measurable difference in performance, but it's more readable this way. Jeff Janes
