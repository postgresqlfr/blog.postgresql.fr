<li>Refactor ALTER some-obj RENAME implementation. Remove duplicate implementations of catalog munging and miscellaneous privilege checks. Instead rely on already existing data in objectaddress.c to do the work. Author: KaiGai Kohei, changes by me. Reviewed by: Robert Haas, &Aacute;lvaro Herrera, Dimitri Fontaine 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/765cbfdc9263bf7c90b9d1f1044c6950b8b7088c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/765cbfdc9263bf7c90b9d1f1044c6950b8b7088c</a></li>

<li>Improve concurrency of foreign key locking This patch introduces two additional lock modes for tuples: "SELECT FOR KEY SHARE" and "SELECT FOR NO KEY UPDATE". These don't block each other, in contrast with already existing "SELECT FOR SHARE" and "SELECT FOR UPDATE". UPDATE commands that do not modify the values stored in the columns that are part of the key of the tuple now grab a SELECT FOR NO KEY UPDATE lock on the tuple, allowing them to proceed concurrently with tuple locks of the FOR KEY SHARE variety. Foreign key triggers now use FOR KEY SHARE instead of FOR SHARE; this means the concurrency improvement applies to them, which is the whole point of this patch. The added tuple lock semantics require some rejiggering of the multixact module, so that the locking level that each transaction is holding can be stored alongside its Xid. Also, multixacts now need to persist across server restarts and crashes, because they can now represent not only tuple locks, but also tuple updates. This means we need more careful tracking of lifetime of pg_multixact SLRU files; since they now persist longer, we require more infrastructure to figure out when they can be removed. pg_upgrade also needs to be careful to copy pg_multixact files over from the old server to the new, or at least part of multixact.c state, depending on the versions of the old and new servers. Tuple time qualification rules (HeapTupleSatisfies routines) need to be careful not to consider tuples with the "is multi" infomask bit set as being only locked; they might need to look up MultiXact values (i.e. possibly do pg_multixact I/O) to find out the Xid that updated a tuple, whereas they previously were assured to only use information readily available from the tuple header. This is considered acceptable, because the extra I/O would involve cases that would previously cause some commands to block waiting for concurrent transactions to finish. Another important change is the fact that locking tuples that have previously been updated causes the future versions to be marked as locked, too; this is essential for correctness of foreign key checks. This causes additional WAL-logging, also (there was previously a single WAL record for a locked tuple; now there are as many as updated copies of the tuple there exist.) With all this in place, contention related to tuples being checked by foreign key rules should be much reduced. As a bonus, the old behavior that a subtransaction grabbing a stronger tuple lock than the parent (sub)transaction held on a given tuple and later aborting caused the weaker lock to be lost, has been fixed. Many new spec files were added for isolation tester framework, to ensure overall behavior is sane. There's probably room for several more tests. There were several reviewers of this patch; in particular, Noah Misch and Andres Freund spent considerable time in it. Original idea for the patch came from Simon Riggs, after a problem report by Joel Jacobson. Most code is from me, with contributions from Marti Raudsepp, Alexander Shulgin, Noah Misch and Andres Freund. This patch was discussed in several pgsql-hackers threads; the most important start at the following message-ids: AANLkTimo9XVcEzfiBR-ut3KVNDkjm2Vxh+t8kAmWjPuv@mail.gmail.com 1290721684-sup-3951@alvh.no-ip.org 1294953201-sup-2099@alvh.no-ip.org 1320343602-sup-2290@alvh.no-ip.org 1339690386-sup-8927@alvh.no-ip.org 4FE5FF020200002500048A3D@gw.wicourts.gov 4FEAB90A0200002500048B7D@gw.wicourts.gov

<li>isolationtester: add a few fflush(stderr) calls. The lack of them is causing failures in some BF members. Per Andrew Dunstan.

<li>Use the catversion to distinguish old/new clusters. This makes 9.3 -&gt; 9.3 upgrades work when they cross the commit that added persistent multixacts; early 9.3 pg_controldata did not have the required oldestMultiXact line, and so would fail to upgrade. per Bruce Momjian

<li>Redefine HEAP_XMAX_IS_LOCKED_ONLY Tuples marked SELECT FOR UPDATE in a cluster that's later processed by pg_upgrade would have a different infomask bit pattern than those produced by 9.3dev; that bit pattern was being seen as "dead" by HEAD (because they would fail the "is this tuple locked" test, and so the visibility rules would thing they're updated, even though there's no HEAP_UPDATED version of them). In other words, some rows could silently disappear after pg_upgrade. With this new definition, those tuples become visible again. This is breakage resulting from my commit 0ac5ad5134.

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Add infrastructure for storing a VARIADIC ANY function's VARIADIC flag. Originally we didn't bother to mark FuncExprs with any indication whether VARIADIC had been given in the source text, because there didn't seem to be any need for it at runtime. However, because we cannot fold a VARIADIC ANY function's arguments into an array (since they're not necessarily all the same type), we do actually need that information at runtime if VARIADIC ANY functions are to respond unsurprisingly to use of the VARIADIC keyword. Add the missing field, and also fix ruleutils.c so that VARIADIC ANY function calls are dumped properly. Extracted from a larger patch that also fixes concat() and format() (the only two extant VARIADIC ANY functions) to behave properly when VARIADIC is specified. This portion seems appropriate to review and commit separately. Pavel Stehule 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/75b39e79099fb1da43542e12698df717d1bd120f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/75b39e79099fb1da43542e12698df717d1bd120f</a></li>

<li>Fix failure to rotate postmaster log file for size reasons on Windows. When we eliminated "unnecessary" wakeups of the syslogger process, we broke size-based logfile rotation on Windows, because on that platform data transfer is done in a separate thread. While non-Windows platforms would recheck the output file size after every log message, Windows only did so when the control thread woke up for some other reason, which might be quite infrequent. Per bug #7814 from Tsunezumi. Back-patch to 9.2 where the problem was introduced. Jeff Janes 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8556869f2f31ce6f5fab68de08fb1556a2134080">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8556869f2f31ce6f5fab68de08fb1556a2134080</a></li>

<li>Fix SPI documentation for new handling of ExecutorRun's count parameter. Since 9.0, the count parameter has only limited the number of tuples actually returned by the executor. It doesn't affect the behavior of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE unless RETURNING is specified, because without RETURNING, the ModifyTable plan node doesn't return control to execMain.c for each tuple. And we only check the limit at the top level. While this behavioral change was unintentional at the time, discussion of bug #6572 led us to the conclusion that we prefer the new behavior anyway, and so we should just adjust the docs to match rather than change the code. Accordingly, do that. Back-patch as far as 9.0 so that the docs match the code in each branch. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2ddc600f8f0252a0864e85d5cc1eeb3b9687d7e9">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2ddc600f8f0252a0864e85d5cc1eeb3b9687d7e9</a></li>

<li>Fix concat() and format() to handle VARIADIC-labeled arguments correctly. Previously, the VARIADIC labeling was effectively ignored, but now these functions act as though the array elements had all been given as separate arguments. Pavel Stehule 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/760f3c043ad4ee622b596d005ec31bb5e0322c4a">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/760f3c043ad4ee622b596d005ec31bb5e0322c4a</a></li>

<li>Change plan caching to honor, not resist, changes in search_path. In the initial implementation of plan caching, we saved the active search_path when a plan was first cached, then reinstalled that path anytime we needed to reparse or replan. The idea of that was to try to reselect the same referenced objects, in somewhat the same way that views continue to refer to the same objects in the face of schema or name changes. Of course, that analogy doesn't bear close inspection, since holding the search_path fixed doesn't cope with object drops or renames. Moreover sticking with the old path seems to create more surprises than it avoids. So instead of doing that, consider that the cached plan depends on search_path, and force reparse/replan if the active search_path is different than it was when we last saved the plan. This gets us fairly close to having "transparency" of plan caching, in the sense that the cached statement acts the same as if you'd just resubmitted the original query text for another execution. There are still some corner cases where this fails though: a new object added in the search path schema(s) might capture a reference in the query text, but we'd not realize that and force a reparse. We might try to fix that in the future, but for the moment it looks too expensive and complicated.

<li>Fix plpython's handling of functions used as triggers on multiple tables. plpython tried to use a single cache entry for a trigger function, but it needs a separate cache entry for each table the trigger is applied to, because there is table-dependent data in there. This was done correctly before 9.1, but commit 46211da1b84bc3537e799ee1126098e71c2428e8 broke it by simplifying the lookup key from "function OID and triggered table OID" to "function OID and is-trigger boolean". Go back to using both OIDs as the lookup key. Per bug report from Sandro Santilli. Andres Freund 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/08be00fabebfa5efb843c9464d994891d80121f5">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/08be00fabebfa5efb843c9464d994891d80121f5</a></li>

<li>Make LATERAL implicit for functions in FROM. The SQL standard does not have general functions-in-FROM, but it does allow UNNEST() there (see the &lt;collection derived table&gt; production), and the semantics of that are defined to include lateral references. So spec compliance requires allowing lateral references within UNNEST() even without an explicit LATERAL keyword. Rather than making UNNEST() a special case, it seems best to extend this flexibility to any function-in-FROM. We'll still allow LATERAL to be written explicitly for clarity's sake, but it's now a noise word in this context. In theory this change could result in a change in behavior of existing queries, by allowing what had been an outer reference in a function-in-FROM to be captured by an earlier FROM-item at the same level. However, all pre-9.3 PG releases have a bug that causes them to match variable references to earlier FROM-items in preference to outer references (and then throw an error). So no previously-working query could contain the type of ambiguity that would risk a change of behavior. Per a suggestion from Andrew Gierth, though I didn't use his patch.

<li>Issue ERROR if FREEZE mode can't be honored by COPY. Previously non-honored FREEZE mode was ignored. This also issues an appropriate error message based on the cause of the failure, per suggestion from Tom. Additional regression test case added.

<li>Allow CREATE TABLE IF EXIST so succeed if the schema is nonexistent Previously, CREATE TABLE IF EXIST threw an error if the schema was nonexistent. This was done by passing 'missing_ok' to the function that looks up the schema oid.

<li>Fix more issues with cascading replication and timeline switches. When a standby server follows the master using WAL archive, and it chooses a new timeline (recovery_target_timeline='latest'), it only fetches the timeline history file for the chosen target timeline, not any other history files that might be missing from pg_xlog. For example, if the current timeline is 2, and we choose 4 as the new recovery target timeline, the history file for timeline 3 is not fetched, even if it's part of this server's history. That's enough for the standby itself - the history file for timeline 4 includes timeline 3 as well - but if a cascading standby server wants to recover to timeline 3, it needs the history file. To fix, when a new recovery target timeline is chosen, try to copy any missing history files from the archive to pg_xlog between the old and new target timeline. A second similar issue was with the WAL files. When a standby recovers from archive, and it reaches a segment that contains a switch to a new timeline, recovery fetches only the WAL file labelled with the new timeline's ID. The file from the new timeline contains a copy of the WAL from the old timeline up to the point where the switch happened, and recovery recovers it from the new file. But in streaming replication, walsender only tries to read it from the old timeline's file. To fix, change walsender to read it from the new file, so that it behaves the same as recovery in that sense, and doesn't try to open the possibly nonexistent file with the old timeline's ID.

<li>Also fix rotation of csvlog on Windows. Backpatch to 9.2, like the previous fix. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/168d315703287989fd9dab0badb212c529e88691">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/168d315703287989fd9dab0badb212c529e88691</a></li>

<li>Add some randomness to the choice of which GiST page to insert to. When descending the tree for an insert, and there are multiple equally good pages we could insert to, make the choice in random. Previously, we would always choose the tuple with lowest offset number. That meant that when two non-leaf pages overlap - in the extreme case they might have exactly the same key - all but the first such page went unused. That wasn't optimal for space usage; if you deleted some tuples from the non-first pages, the space would never be reused. With this patch, the other pages are sometimes chosen too, although there's still a heavy bias towards low-offset tuples, so that we don't lose cache locality when doing a lot of inserts with similar keys. Original idea by Alexander Korotkov, although this patch version was written by me and copy-edited by Tom Lane.
