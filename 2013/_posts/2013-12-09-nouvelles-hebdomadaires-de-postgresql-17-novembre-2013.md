<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Re-allow duplicate aliases within aliased JOINs. Although the SQL spec forbids duplicate table aliases, historically we've allowed queries like SELECT ... FROM tab1 x CROSS JOIN (tab2 x CROSS JOIN tab3 y) z on the grounds that the aliased join (z) hides the aliases within it, therefore there is no conflict between the two RTEs named "x". The LATERAL patch broke this, on the misguided basis that "x" could be ambiguous if tab3 were a LATERAL subquery. To avoid breaking existing queries, it's better to allow this situation and complain only if tab3 actually does contain an ambiguous reference. We need only remove the check that was throwing an error, because the column lookup code is already prepared to handle ambiguous references. Per bug #8444.

<li>Fix ruleutils pretty-printing to not generate trailing whitespace. The pretty-printing logic in ruleutils.c operates by inserting a newline and some indentation whitespace into strings that are already valid SQL. This naturally results in leaving some trailing whitespace before the newline in many cases; which can be annoying when processing the output with other tools, as complained of by Joe Abbate. We can fix that in a pretty localized fashion by deleting any trailing whitespace before we append a pretty-printing newline. In addition, we have to modify the code inserted by commit 2f582f76b1945929ff07116cd4639747ce9bb8a1 so that we also delete trailing whitespace when transposing items from temporary buffers into the main result string, when a temporary item starts with a newline. This results in rather voluminous changes to the regression test results, but it's easily verified that they are only removal of trailing whitespace. Back-patch to 9.3, because the aforementioned commit resulted in many more cases of trailing whitespace than had occurred in earlier branches.

<li>Fix failure with whole-row reference to a subquery. Simple oversight in commit 1cb108efb0e60d87e4adec38e7636b6e8efbeb57 --- recursively examining a subquery output column is only sane if the original Var refers to a single output column. Found by Kevin Grittner.

<li>Clarify CREATE FUNCTION documentation about handling of typmods. The previous text was a bit misleading, as well as unnecessarily vague about what information would be discarded. Per gripe from Craig Skinner.

<li>Fix incorrect column name in psql \d code. pg_index.indisreplident had at one time in its development been called indisidentity. describe.c got missed when it was renamed. Bug introduced in commit 07cacba983ef79be4a84fcd0e0ca3b5fcb85dd65. Andres Freund

<li>Add a regression test case for \d on an index. Previous commit shows the need for this. The coverage isn't really thorough, but it's better than nothing.

<li>Minor comment corrections for sequence hashtable patch. There were enough typos in the comments to annoy me ... 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/80e3a470ba46bc35fb1ec22d4e97126270f3d2b3">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/80e3a470ba46bc35fb1ec22d4e97126270f3d2b3</a></li>

<li>Prevent leakage of cached plans and execution trees in plpgsql DO blocks. plpgsql likes to cache query plans and simple-expression execution state trees across calls. This is a considerable win for multiple executions of the same function. However, it's useless for DO blocks, since by definition those are executed only once and discarded. Nonetheless, we were allowing a DO block's expression execution trees to survive until end of transaction, resulting in a significant intra-transaction memory leak, as reported by Yeb Havinga. Worse, if the DO block exited with an error, the compiled form of the block's code was leaked till end of session --- along with subsidiary plancache entries. To fix, make DO blocks keep their expression execution trees in a private EState that's deleted at exit from the block, and add a PG_TRY block to plpgsql_inline_handler to make sure that memory cleanup happens even on error exits. Also add a regression test covering error handling in a DO block, because my first try at this broke that. (The test is not meant to prove that we don't leak memory anymore, though it could be used for that with a much larger loop count.) Ideally we'd back-patch this into all versions supporting DO blocks; but the patch needs to add a field to struct PLpgSQL_execstate, and that would break ABI compatibility for third-party plugins such as the plpgsql debugger. Given the small number of complaints so far, fixing this in HEAD only seems like an acceptable choice.

<li>Compute correct em_nullable_relids in get_eclass_for_sort_expr(). Bug #8591 from Claudio Freire demonstrates that get_eclass_for_sort_expr must be able to compute valid em_nullable_relids for any new equivalence class members it creates. I'd worried about this in the commit message for db9f0e1d9a4a0842c814a464cdc9758c3f20b96c, but claimed that it wasn't a problem because multi-member ECs should already exist when it runs. That is transparently wrong, though, because this function is also called by initialize_mergeclause_eclasses, which runs during deconstruct_jointree. The example given in the bug report (which the new regression test item is based upon) fails because the COALESCE() expression is first seen by initialize_mergeclause_eclasses rather than process_equivalence. Fixing this requires passing the appropriate nullable_relids set to get_eclass_for_sort_expr, and it requires new code to compute that set for top-level expressions such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, etc. We store the top-level nullable_relids in a new field in PlannerInfo to avoid computing it many times. In the back branches, I've added the new field at the end of the struct to minimize ABI breakage for planner plugins. There doesn't seem to be a good alternative to changing get_eclass_for_sort_expr's API signature, though. There probably aren't any third-party extensions calling that function directly; moreover, if there are, they probably need to think about what to pass for nullable_relids anyway. Back-patch to 9.2, like the previous patch in this area.

<li>Clean up password prompting logic in streamutil.c. The previous coding was fairly unreadable and drew double-free warnings from clang. I believe the double free was actually not reachable, because PQconnectionNeedsPassword is coded to not return true if a password was provided, so that the loop can't iterate more than twice. Nonetheless it seems worth rewriting. No back-patch since this is just cosmetic.

<li>Speed up printing of INSERT statements in pg_dump. In --inserts and especially --column-inserts mode, we can get a useful speedup by generating the common prefix of all a table's INSERT commands just once, and then printing the prebuilt string for each row. This avoids multiple invocations of fmtId() and other minor fooling around. David Rowley

<li>Fix incorrect loop counts in tidbitmap.c. A couple of places that should have been iterating over WORDS_PER_CHUNK words were iterating over WORDS_PER_PAGE words instead. This thinko accidentally failed to fail, because (at least on common architectures with default BLCKSZ) WORDS_PER_CHUNK is a bit less than WORDS_PER_PAGE, and the extra words being looked at were always zero so nothing happened. Still, it's a bug waiting to happen if anybody ever fools with the parameters affecting TIDBitmap sizes, and it's a small waste of cycles too. So back-patch to all active branches. Etsuro Fujita

<li>Remove pgbench's hardwired limit on line length in custom script files. pgbench formerly failed on lines longer than BUFSIZ, unexpectedly splitting them into multiple commands. Allow it to work with any length of input line. Sawada Masahiko 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/61a07bae47886b8333b9cce882d73d5fdaaec618">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/61a07bae47886b8333b9cce882d73d5fdaaec618</a></li>

<li>Allow aggregates to provide estimates of their transition state data size. Formerly the planner had a hard-wired rule of thumb for guessing the amount of space consumed by an aggregate function's transition state data. This estimate is critical to deciding whether it's OK to use hash aggregation, and in many situations the built-in estimate isn't very good. This patch adds a column to pg_aggregate wherein a per-aggregate estimate can be provided, overriding the planner's default, and infrastructure for setting the column via CREATE AGGREGATE. It may be that additional smarts will be required in future, perhaps even a per-aggregate estimation function. But this is already a step forward. This is extracted from a larger patch to improve the performance of numeric and int8 aggregates. I (tgl) thought it was worth reviewing and committing this infrastructure separately. In this commit, all built-in aggregates are given aggtransspace = 0, so no behavior should change. Hadi Moshayedi, reviewed by Pavel Stehule and Tomas Vondra

<li>Improve performance of numeric sum(), avg(), stddev(), variance(), etc. This patch improves performance of most built-in aggregates that formerly used a NUMERIC or NUMERIC array as their transition type; this includes not only aggregates on numeric inputs, but some aggregates on integer inputs where overflow of an int8 value is a possibility. The code now uses a special-purpose data structure to avoid array construction and deconstruction overhead, as well as packing and unpacking overhead for numeric values. These aggregates' transition type is now declared as INTERNAL, since it doesn't correspond to any SQL data type. To keep the planner from thinking that that means a lot of storage will be used, we make use of the just-added pg_aggregate.aggtransspace feature. The space estimate is set to 128 bytes, which is at least in the right ballpark. Hadi Moshayedi, reviewed by Pavel Stehule and Tomas Vondra

<li>Try again to make pg_isolation_regress work its build directory. We can't search for the isolationtester binary until after we've set up the environment, because otherwise when find_other_exec() tries to invoke it with the -V option, it might fail for inability to locate a working libpq. So postpone that step. Andres Freund

<li>Fix relfilenodemap.c's handling of cache invalidations. The old code entered a new hash table entry first, then scanned pg_class to determine what value to fill in, and then populated the entry. This fails to work properly if a cache invalidation happens as a result of opening pg_class. Repair. Along the way, get rid of the idea of blowing away the entire hash table as a method of processing invalidations. Instead, just delete all the entries one by one. This is probably not quite as cheap but it's simpler, and shouldn't happen often. Andres Freund

<li>Fix bug in GIN posting tree root creation. The root page is filled with as many items as fit, and the rest are inserted using normal insertions. However, I fumbled the variable names, and the code actually memcpy'd all the items on the page, overflowing the buffer. While at it, rename the variable to make the distinction more clear.
