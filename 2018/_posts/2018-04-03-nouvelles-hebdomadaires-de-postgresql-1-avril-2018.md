<li>libpq: PQhost to return active connected host or hostaddr. Previously, PQhost didn't return the connected host details when the connection type was CHT_HOST_ADDRESS (i.e., via hostaddr). Instead, it returned the complete host connection parameter (which could contain multiple hosts) or the default host details, which was confusing and arguably incorrect. Change this to return the actually connected host or hostaddr irrespective of the connection type. When hostaddr but no host was specified, hostaddr is now returned. Never return the original host connection parameter, and document that PQhost cannot be relied on before the connection is established. PQport is similarly changed to always return the active connection port and never the original connection parameter.

<li>PL/pgSQL: Nested CALL with transactions. So far, a nested CALL or DO in PL/pgSQL would not establish a context where transaction control statements were allowed. This fixes that by handling CALL and DO specially in PL/pgSQL, passing the atomic/nonatomic execution context through and doing the required management around transaction boundaries.

<li>Allow committing inside cursor loop. Previously, committing or aborting inside a cursor loop was prohibited because that would close and remove the cursor. To allow that, automatically convert such cursors to holdable cursors so they survive commits or rollbacks. Portals now have a new state "auto-held", which means they have been converted automatically from pinned. An auto-held portal is kept on transaction commit or rollback, but is still removed when returning to the main loop on error. This supports all languages that have cursor loop constructs: PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, PL/Perl.

<li>Fix unsafe extraction of the OID part of a relation filename. Commit 8694cc96b did this randomly differently from other callers of parse_filename_for_nontemp_relation(). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the randomly different way is wrong; it fails to ensure the extracted string is null-terminated. Per buildfarm member skink.

<li>Doc: add example of type resolution in nested UNIONs. Section 10.5 didn't say explicitly that multiple UNIONs are resolved pairwise. Since the resolution algorithm is described as taking any number of inputs, readers might well think that a query like "select x union select y union select z" would be resolved by considering x, y, and z in one resolution step. But that's not what happens (and I think that behavior is per SQL spec). Add an example clarifying this point. Per bug #15129 from Philippe Beaudoin.

<li>Allow memory contexts to have both fixed and variable ident strings. Originally, we treated memory context names as potentially variable in all cases, and therefore always copied them into the context header. Commit 9fa6f00b1 rethought this a little bit and invented a distinction between fixed and variable names, skipping the copy step for the former. But we can make things both simpler and more useful by instead allowing there to be two parts to a context's identification, a fixed "name" and an optional, variable "ident". The name supplied in the context create call is now required to be a compile-time-constant string in all cases, as it is never copied but just pointed to. The "ident" string, if wanted, is supplied later. This is needed because typically we want the ident to be stored inside the context so that it's cleaned up automatically on context deletion; that means it has to be copied into the context before we can set the pointer. The cost of this approach is basically just an additional pointer field in struct MemoryContextData, which isn't much overhead, and is bought back entirely in the AllocSet case by not needing a headerSize field anymore, since we no longer have to cope with variable header length. In addition, we can simplify the internal interfaces for memory context creation still further, saving a few cycles there. And it's no longer true that a custom identifier disqualifies a context from participating in aset.c's freelist scheme, so possibly there's some win on that end. All the places that were using non-compile-time-constant context names are adjusted to put the variable info into the "ident" instead. This allows more effective identification of those contexts in many cases; for example, subsidary contexts of relcache entries are now identified by both type (e.g. "index info") and relname, where before you got only one or the other. Contexts associated with PL function cache entries are now identified more fully and uniformly, too. I also arranged for plancache contexts to use the query source string as their identifier. This is basically free for CachedPlanSources, as they contained a copy of that string already. We pay an extra pstrdup to do it for CachedPlans. That could perhaps be avoided, but it would make things more fragile (since the CachedPlanSource is sometimes destroyed first). I suspect future improvements in error reporting will require CachedPlans to have a copy of that string anyway, so it's not clear that it's worth moving mountains to avoid it now. This also changes the APIs for context statistics routines so that the context-specific routines no longer assume that output goes straight to stderr, nor do they know all details of the output format. This is useful immediately to reduce code duplication, and it also allows for external code to do something with stats output that's different from printing to stderr. The reason for pushing this now rather than waiting for v12 is that it rethinks some of the API changes made by commit 9fa6f00b1. Seems better for extension authors to endure just one round of API changes not two.

<li>Update pgindent's typedefs blacklist, and make it easier to adjust. It seems that all buildfarm members are now using the &lt;stdbool.h&gt; code path, so that none of them report "bool" as a typedef. We still need it to be treated that way, so adjust pgindent to force that whether or not it's in the given list. Also, the recent introduction of LLVM infrastructure has caused the appearance of some typedef names that we definitely *don't* want treated as typedefs, such as "string" and "abs". Extend the existing blacklist to include these. (Additions based on comparing v10's typedefs list to what the buildfarm is currently emitting.) Rearrange the code so that the lists of whitelisted/blacklisted names are a bit easier to find and modify.

<li>Fix actual and potential double-frees around tuplesort usage. tuplesort_gettupleslot() passed back tuples allocated in the tuplesort's own memory context, even when the caller was responsible to free them. This created a double-free hazard, because some callers might destroy the tuplesort object (via tuplesort_end) before trying to clean up the last returned tuple. To avoid this, change the API to specify that the tuple is allocated in the caller's memory context. v10 and HEAD already did things that way, but in 9.5 and 9.6 this is a live bug that can demonstrably cause crashes with some grouping-set usages. In 9.5 and 9.6, this requires doing an extra tuple copy in some cases, which is unfortunate. But the amount of refactoring needed to avoid it seems excessive for a back-patched change, especially since the cases where an extra copy happens are less performance-critical. Likewise change tuplesort_getdatum() to return pass-by-reference Datums in the caller's context not the tuplesort's context. There seem to be no live bugs among its callers, but clearly the same sort of situation could happen in future. For other tuplesort fetch routines, continue to allocate the memory in the tuplesort's context. This is a little inconsistent with what we now do for tuplesort_gettupleslot() and tuplesort_getdatum(), but that's preferable to adding new copy overhead in the back branches where it's clearly unnecessary. These other fetch routines provide the weakest possible guarantees about tuple memory lifespan from v10 on, anyway, so this actually seems more consistent overall. Adjust relevant comments to reflect these API redefinitions. Arguably, we should change the pre-9.5 branches as well, but since there are no known failure cases there, it seems not worth the risk.

<li>While vacuuming a large table, update upper-level FSM data every so often. VACUUM updates leaf-level FSM entries immediately after cleaning the corresponding heap blocks. fsmpage.c updates the intra-page search trees on the leaf-level FSM pages when this happens, but it does not touch the upper-level FSM pages, so that the released space might not actually be findable by searchers. Previously, updating the upper-level pages happened only at the conclusion of the VACUUM run, in a single FreeSpaceMapVacuum() call. This is bad because the VACUUM might get canceled before ever reaching that point, so that from the point of view of searchers no space has been freed at all, leading to table bloat. We can improve matters by updating the upper pages immediately after each cycle of index-cleaning and heap-cleaning, processing just the FSM pages corresponding to the range of heap blocks we have now fully cleaned. This adds a small amount of extra work, since the FSM pages leading down to each range boundary will be touched twice, but it's pretty negligible compared to everything else going on in a large VACUUM. If there are no indexes, VACUUM doesn't work in cycles but just cleans each heap page on first visit. In that case we just arbitrarily update upper FSM pages after each 8GB of heap. That maintains the goal of not letting all this work slide until the very end, and it doesn't seem worth expending extra complexity on a case that so seldom occurs in practice. In either case, the FSM is fully up to date before any attempt is made to truncate the relation, so that the most likely scenario for VACUUM cancellation no longer results in out-of-date upper FSM pages. When we do successfully truncate, adjusting the FSM to reflect that is now fully handled within FreeSpaceMapTruncateRel.</li>

<li>Remove UpdateFreeSpaceMap(), use FreeSpaceMapVacuumRange() instead. FreeSpaceMapVacuumRange has the same effect, is more efficient if many pages are involved, and makes fewer assumptions about how it's used. Notably, Claudio Freire pointed out that UpdateFreeSpaceMap could fail if the specified freespace value isn't the maximum possible. This isn't a problem for the single existing user, but the function represents an attractive nuisance IMO, because it's named as though it were a general-purpose update function and its limitations are undocumented. In any case we don't need multiple ways to get the same result. In passing, do some code review and cleanup in RelationAddExtraBlocks. In particular, I see no excuse for it to omit the PageIsNew safety check that's done in the mainline extension path in RelationGetBufferForTuple.

<li>Remove unnecessary BufferGetPage() calls in fsm_vacuum_page(). Just noticed that these were quite redundant, since we're holding the page address in a local variable anyway, and we have pin on the buffer throughout. Also improve a comment. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2b1759e2675fc01d6945c9a5fa65c7d7121212f7">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2b1759e2675fc01d6945c9a5fa65c7d7121212f7</a></li>

<li>Do index FSM vacuuming sooner. In btree and SP-GiST indexes, move the responsibility for calling IndexFreeSpaceMapVacuum from the vacuumcleanup phase to the bulkdelete phase, and do it if and only if we found some pages that could be put into FSM. As in commit 851a26e26, the idea is to make free pages visible to FSM searchers sooner when vacuuming very large tables (large enough to need multiple bulkdelete scans). This adds more redundant work than that commit did, since we have to scan the entire index FSM each time rather than being able to localize what needs to be updated; but it still seems worthwhile. However, we can buy something back by not touching the FSM at all when there are no pages that can be put in it. That will result in slower recovery from corrupt upper FSM pages in such a scenario, but it doesn't seem like that's a case we need to optimize for. Hash indexes don't use FSM at all. GIN, GiST, and bloom indexes update FSM during the vacuumcleanup phase not bulkdelete, so that doing something comparable to this would be a much more invasive change, and it's not clear it's worth it. BRIN indexes do things sufficiently differently that this change doesn't apply to them, either.

<li>Improve out-of-memory error reports by including memory context name. Add the target context's name to the errdetail field of "out of memory" errors in mcxt.c. Per discussion, this seems likely to be useful to help narrow down the cause of a reported failure, and it costs little. Also, now that context names are required to be compile-time constants in all cases, there's little reason to be concerned about security issues from exposing these names to users. (Because of such concerns, we are *not* including the context "ident" field.) In passing, add unlikely() markers to the allocation-failed tests, just to be sure the compiler is on the right page about that. Also, in palloc and friends, copy CurrentMemoryContext into a local variable, as that's almost surely cheaper to reference than a global.

<li>Remove obsolete SLRU wrapping and warnings from predicate.c. When SSI was developed, slru.c was limited to segment files with names in the range 0000-FFFF. This didn't allow enough space for predicate.c to store every possible XID when spilling old transactions to disk, so it would wrap around sooner and print warnings. Since commits 638cf09e and 73c986ad increased the number of segment files slru.c could manage, that behavior is unnecessary. Therefore remove that code. Also remove the macro OldSerXidSegment, which has been unused since 4cd3fb6e.

<li>Ensure that WAL pages skipped by a forced WAL switch are zero-filled. In the previous coding, skipped pages were mostly zeroes, but they still had valid WAL page headers.

<li>Fix bogus provolatile/proparallel markings on a few built-in functions. Richard Yen reported that pg_upgrade failed if the target cluster had force_parallel_mode = on, because binary_upgrade_create_empty_extension() is marked parallel restricted, allowing it to be executed in parallel mode, which complains because it tries to acquire an XID. In general, no function that might try to modify database data should be considered parallel safe or restricted, since execution of it might force XID acquisition. We found several other examples of this mistake. Furthermore, functions that execute user-supplied SQL queries or query fragments, or pull data from user-supplied cursors, had better be marked both volatile and parallel unsafe, because we don't know what the supplied query or cursor might try to do. There were several tsquery and XML functions that had the wrong proparallel marking for this, and some of them were even mislabeled as to volatility. All these bugs are old, dating back to 9.6 for the proparallel mistakes and much further for the provolatile mistakes. We can't force a catversion bump in the back branches, but we can at least ensure that installations initdb'd in future have the right values.

<li>Fix assorted issues in parallel vacuumdb. Avoid storing the result of PQsocket() in a pgsocket variable; it's declared as int, and the no-socket test is properly written as "x &lt; 0" not "x == PGINVALID_SOCKET". This accidentally had no bad effect because we never got to init_slot() with a bad connection, but it's still wrong. Actually, it seems like we should avoid storing the result for a long period at all. The function's not so expensive that it's worth avoiding, and the existing coding technique here would fail if anyone tried to PQreset the connection during the life of the program. Hence, just re-call PQsocket every time we construct a select(2) mask. Speaking of select(), GetIdleSlot imagined that it could compute the select mask once and continue to use it over multiple calls to select_loop(), which is pretty bogus since that would stomp on the mask on return. This could only matter if the function's outer loop iterated more than once, which is unlikely (it'd take some connection receiving data, but not enough to complete its command). But if it did happen, we'd acquire "tunnel vision" and stop watching the other connections for query termination, with the effect of losing parallelism. Another way in which GetIdleSlot could lose parallelism is that once PQisBusy returns false, it would lock in on that connection and do PQgetResult until that returns NULL; in some cases that could result in blocking. (Perhaps this can never happen in vacuumdb due to the limited set of commands that it can issue, but I'm not quite sure of that, and even if true today it's not a future-proof assumption.) Refactor the code to do that properly, so that it risks blocking in PQgetResult only in cases where we need to wait anyway. Another loss-of-parallelism problem, which *is* easily demonstrable, is that any setup queries issued during prepare_vacuum_command() were always issued on the last-to-be-created connection, whether or not that was idle. Long-running operations on that connection thus prevented issuance of additional operations on the other ones, except in the limited cases where no preparatory query was needed. Instead, wait till we've identified a free connection and use that one. Also, avoid core dump due to undersized malloc request in the case that no tables are identified to be vacuumed. The bogus no-socket test was noted by CharSyam, the other problems identified in my own code review. Back-patch to 9.5 where parallel vacuumdb was introduced.

<li>Fast ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN with a non-NULL default. Currently adding a column to a table with a non-NULL default results in a rewrite of the table. For large tables this can be both expensive and disruptive. This patch removes the need for the rewrite as long as the default value is not volatile. The default expression is evaluated at the time of the ALTER TABLE and the result stored in a new column (attmissingval) in pg_attribute, and a new column (atthasmissing) is set to true. Any existing row when fetched will be supplied with the attmissingval. New rows will have the supplied value or the default and so will never need the attmissingval. Any time the table is rewritten all the atthasmissing and attmissingval settings for the attributes are cleared, as they are no longer needed. The most visible code change from this is in heap_attisnull, which acquires a third TupleDesc argument, allowing it to detect a missing value if there is one. In many cases where it is known that there will not be any (e.g. catalog relations) NULL can be passed for this argument. Andrew Dunstan, heavily modified from an original patch from Serge Rielau.

<li>Optimize btree insertions for common case of increasing values. Remember the last page of an index insert if it's the rightmost leaf page. If the next entry belongs on and can fit in the remembered page, insert the new entry there as long as we can get a lock on the page. Otherwise, fall back on the more expensive method of searching for the right place to insert the entry. This provides a performance improvement for the common case where an index entry is for monotonically increasing or nearly monotonically increasing value such as an identity field or a current timestamp.

<li>JIT tuple deforming in LLVM JIT provider. Performing JIT compilation for deforming gains performance benefits over unJITed deforming from compile-time knowledge of the tuple descriptor. Fixed column widths, NOT NULLness, etc can be taken advantage of. Right now the JITed deforming is only used when deforming tuples as part of expression evaluation (and obviously only if the descriptor is known). It's likely to be beneficial in other cases, too. By default tuple deforming is JITed whenever an expression is JIT compiled. There's a separate boolean GUC controlling it, but that's expected to be primarily useful for development and benchmarking. Docs will follow in a later commit containing docs for the whole JIT feature.

<li>Add inlining support to LLVM JIT provider. This provides infrastructure to allow JITed code to inline code implemented in C. This e.g. can be postgres internal functions or extension code. This already speeds up long running queries, by allowing the LLVM optimizer to optimize across function boundaries. The optimization potential currently doesn't reach its full potential because LLVM cannot optimize the FunctionCallInfoData argument fully away, because it's allocated on the heap rather than the stack. Fixing that is beyond what's realistic for v11. To be able to do that, use CLANG to convert C code to LLVM bitcode, and have LLVM build a summary for it. That bitcode can then be used to to inline functions at runtime. For that the bitcode needs to be installed. Postgres bitcode goes into $pkglibdir/bitcode/postgres, extensions go into equivalent directories. PGXS has been modified so that happens automatically if postgres has been compiled with LLVM support. Currently this isn't the fastest inline implementation, modules are reloaded from disk during inlining. That's to work around an apparent LLVM bug, triggering an apparently spurious error in LLVM assertion enabled builds. Once that is resolved we can remove the superfluous read from disk.

<li>Remove PARTIAL_LINKING build mode. In 9956ddc19164b02dc1925fb389a1af77472eba5e, ten years ago, the current objfile.txt based linking model was introduced. It's time to retire the old SUBSYS.o based model. This primarily is pertinent because the bitcode files for LLVM based inlining are not produced when using PARTIAL_LINKING. It does not seem worth to fix PARTIAL_LINKING to support that.

<li>Add Bloom filter implementation. A Bloom filter is a space-efficient, probabilistic data structure that can be used to test set membership. Callers will sometimes incur false positives, but never false negatives. The rate of false positives is a function of the total number of elements and the amount of memory available for the Bloom filter. Two classic applications of Bloom filters are cache filtering, and data synchronization testing. Any user of Bloom filters must accept the possibility of false positives as a cost worth paying for the benefit in space efficiency. This commit adds a test harness extension module, test_bloomfilter. It can be used to get a sense of how the Bloom filter implementation performs under varying conditions. This is infrastructure for the upcoming "heapallindexed" amcheck patch, which verifies the consistency of a heap relation against one of its indexes.

<li>Add amcheck verification of heap relations belonging to btree indexes. Add a new, optional, capability to bt_index_check() and bt_index_parent_check(): check that each heap tuple that should have an index entry does in fact have one. The extra checking is performed at the end of the existing nbtree checks. This is implemented by using a Bloom filter data structure. The implementation performs set membership tests within a callback (the same type of callback that each index AM registers for CREATE INDEX). The Bloom filter is populated during the initial index verification scan. Reusing the CREATE INDEX infrastructure allows the new verification option to automatically benefit from the heap consistency checks that CREATE INDEX already performs. CREATE INDEX does thorough sanity checking of HOT chains, so the new check actually manages to detect problems in heap-only tuples.

<li>Fix handling of files that source server removes during pg_rewind is running. After processing the filemap to build the list of chunks that will be fetched from the source to rewing the target server, it is possible that a file which was previously processed is removed from the source. A simple example of such an occurence is a WAL segment which gets recycled on the target in-between. When the filemap is processed, files not categorized as relation files are first truncated to prepare for its full copy of which is going to be taken from the source, divided into a set of junks. However, for a recycled WAL segment, this would result in a segment which has a zero-byte size. With such an empty file, post-rewind recovery thinks that records are saved but they are actually not because of the truncation which happened when processing the filemap, resulting in data loss. In order to fix the problem, make sure that files which are found as removed on the source when receiving chunks of them are as well deleted on the target server for consistency.

<li>Make pg_rewind skip files and directories that are removed during server start. The target cluster that was rewound needs to perform recovery from the checkpoint created at failover, which leads it to remove or recreate some files and directories that may have been copied from the source cluster.

<li>Teach create_projection_plan to omit projection where possible. We sometimes insert a ProjectionPath into a plan tree when projection is not strictly required. The existing code already arranges to avoid emitting a Result node when the ProjectionPath's subpath can perform the projection itself, but previously it didn't consider the possibility that the parent node might not actually require the projection to be performed at all. Skipping projection when it's not required can not only avoid Result nodes that aren't needed, but also avoid losing the "physical tlist" optimization unneccessarily. Patch by me, reviewed by Amit Kapila.

<li>Postpone generate_gather_paths for topmost scan/join rel. Don't call generate_gather_paths for the topmost scan/join relation when it is initially populated with paths. Instead, do the work in grouping_planner. By itself, this gains nothing; in fact it loses slightly because we end up calling set_cheapest() for the topmost scan/join rel twice rather than once. However, it paves the way for a future commit which will postpone generate_gather_paths for the topmost scan/join relation even further, allowing more accurate costing of parallel paths.

Earlier versions of this patch (which different substantially) were reviewed by Dilip Kumar, Amit Khandekar, Marina Polyakova, and Ashutosh Bapat. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3f90ec8597c3515e0d3190613b31491686027e4b">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3f90ec8597c3515e0d3190613b31491686027e4b</a></li>

<li>Rewrite the code that applies scan/join targets to paths. If the toplevel scan/join target list is parallel-safe, postpone generating Gather (or Gather Merge) paths until after the toplevel has been adjusted to return it. This (correctly) makes queries with expensive functions in the target list more likely to choose a parallel plan, since the cost of the plan now reflects the fact that the evaluation will happen in the workers rather than the leader. The original complaint about this problem was from Jeff Janes. If the toplevel scan/join relation is partitioned, recursively apply the changes to all partitions. This sometimes allows us to get rid of Result nodes, because Append is not projection-capable but its children may be. It also cleans up what appears to be incorrect SRF handling from commit e2f1eb0ee30d144628ab523432320f174a2c8966: the old code had no knowledge of SRFs for child scan/join rels. Because we now use create_projection_path() in some cases where we formerly used apply_projection_to_path(), this changes the ordering of columns in some queries generated by postgres_fdw. Update regression outputs accordingly. Patch by me, reviewed by Amit Kapila and by Ashutosh Bapat. Other fixes for this problem (substantially different from this version) were reviewed by Dilip Kumar, Amit Khandekar, and Marina Polyakova.

<li>Don't call IS_DUMMY_REL() when cheapest_total_path might be junk. Unlike the previous coding, this might result in a Gather per Append subplan when the target list is parallel-restricted, but such a plan is probably worth considering in that case, since a single Gather on top of the entire Append is impossible.

<li>Fix bug with view locking code. LockViewRecurese() obtains view relation using heap_open() and passes it to get_view_query() to get view info. It immediately closes the relation then uses the returned view info by calling LockViewRecurse_walker(). Since get_view_query() returns a pointer within the relcache, the relcache should be kept until LockViewRecurse_walker() returns. Otherwise the relation could point to a garbage memory area. Fix is moving the heap_close() call after LockViewRecurse_walker(). Problem reported by Tom Lane (buildfarm is unhappy, especially prion since it enables -DRELCACHE_FORCE_RELEASE cpp flag), fix by me. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1b26bd4089a388929c644ffea2832f3841c25969">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1b26bd4089a388929c644ffea2832f3841c25969</a></li>
