<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<p>Tom Lane pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Avoid misleading psql password prompt when username is multiply specified. When a password is needed, cases such as psql -d "postgresql://alice@localhost/testdb" -U bob would incorrectly prompt for "Password for user bob: ", when actually the connection will be attempted with username alice. The priority order of which name to use isn't that important here, but the misleading prompt is. When we are prompting for a password after initial connection failure, we can fix this reliably by looking at PQuser(conn) to see how libpq interpreted the connection arguments. But when we're doing a forced password prompt because of a -W switch, we can't use that solution. Fortunately, because the main use of -W is for noninteractive situations, it's less critical to produce a helpful prompt in such cases. I made the startup prompt for -W just say "Password: " all the time, rather than expending extra code on trying to identify which username to use. In the case of a \c command (after -W has been given), there's already logic in do_connect that determines whether the "dbname" is a connstring or URI, so we can avoid lobotomizing the prompt except in cases that are actually dubious. (We could do similarly in startup.c if anyone complains, but for now it seems not worthwhile, especially since that would still be only a partial solution.) Per bug #15025 from Akos Vandra. Although this is arguably a bug fix, it doesn't seem worth back-patching. The case where it matters seems like a very corner-case usage, and someone might complain that we'd changed the behavior of -W in a minor release.

<li>Save a few bytes by removing useless last argument to SearchCatCacheList. There's never any value in giving a fully specified cache key to SearchCatCacheList: you might as well call SearchCatCache instead, since there could be only one match. So the maximum useful number of key arguments is one less than the supported number of key columns. We might as well remove the useless extra argument and save some few bytes per call site, as well as a cycle or so per call. I believe the reason it was coded like this is that originally, callers had to write out all the dummy arguments in each call, and so it seemed less confusing if SearchCatCache and SearchCatCacheList took the same number of key arguments. But since commit e26c539e9, callers only write their live arguments explicitly, making that a non-factor; and there's surely been enough time for third-party modules to adapt to that coding style. So this is only an ABI break not an API break for callers. Per discussion with Oliver Ford, this might also make it less confusing how to use SearchCatCacheList correctly.

<li>First-draft release notes for 10.2. As usual, the release notes for other branches will be made by cutting these down, but put them up for community review first. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bf641d3376018c40860f26167a60febff5bc1f51">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bf641d3376018c40860f26167a60febff5bc1f51</a></li>

<li>Be more wary about shm_toc_lookup failure. Commit 445dbd82a basically missed the point of commit d46633506, which was that we shouldn't allow shm_toc_lookup() failure to lead to a core dump or assertion crash, because the odds of such a failure should never be considered negligible. It's correct that we can't expect the PARALLEL_KEY_ERROR_QUEUE TOC entry to be there if we have no workers. But if we have no workers, we're not going to do anything in this function with the lookup result anyway, so let's just skip it. That lets the code use the easy-to-prove-safe noError=false case, rather than anything requiring effort to review. Back-patch to v10, like the previous commit.

<li>Fix another instance of unsafe coding for shm_toc_lookup failure. One or another author of commit 5bcf389ec seems to have thought that computing an offset from a NULL pointer would yield another NULL pointer. There may possibly be architectures where that works, but common machines don't work like that. Per a quick code review of places calling shm_toc_lookup and not using noError = false. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d59ff4ab3111f20054425d82dab1393101dcfe8e">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d59ff4ab3111f20054425d82dab1393101dcfe8e</a></li>

<li>Minor copy-editing for 10.2 release notes. Second pass after taking a break ... <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/794eb3a8f00519fac561831dee35f4ee557bd08b">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/794eb3a8f00519fac561831dee35f4ee557bd08b</a></li>

<li>Improve bit perturbation in TupleHashTableHash. The changes in b81b5a96f424531b97cdd1dba97d9d1b9c9d372e did not fully address the issue, because the bit-mixing of the IV into the final hash-key didn't prevent clustering in the input-data survive in the output data. This didn't cause a lot of problems because of the additional growth conditions added d4c62a6b623d6eef88218158e9fa3cf974c6c7e5. But as we want to rein those in due to explosive growth in some edges, this needs to be fixed.

<li>Prevent growth of simplehash tables when they're "too empty". In cases where simplehash tables where filled with either a lot of conflicting hash-values, or values that hash to consecutive values (i.e. build "chains") the growth heuristics in d4c62a6b623d6eef88218158e9fa3cf974c6c7e5 could trigger rather explosively. To fix that, address some of the reasons (see previous commit) of why the growth heuristics where needed, and only allow growth when the table isn't too empty. While that means there's a few cases of bad input that can be slower, that seems a lot better than running very quickly out of memory.

<li>Introduce ExecQualAndReset() helper. It's a common task to evaluate a qual and reset the corresponding expression context. Currently that requires storing the result of the qual eval, resetting the context, and then reacting on the result. As that's awkward several places only reset the context next time through a node. That's not great, so introduce a helper that evaluates and resets. It's a bit ugly that it currently uses MemoryContextReset() instead of ResetExprContext(), but that seems easier than reordering all of executor.h.

<li>Initialize unused ExprEvalStep fields. ExecPushExprSlots didn't initialize ExprEvalStep's resvalue/resnull steps as it didn't use them. That caused wrong valgrind warnings for an upcoming patch, so zero-intialize. Also zero-initialize all scratch ExprEvalStep's allocated on the stack, to avoid issues with similar future omissions of non-critial data. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fc96c6942551dafa6cb2a6000cbc9b20643e5db3">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fc96c6942551dafa6cb2a6000cbc9b20643e5db3</a></li>

Otherwise, scan-build complains about a dead assignment. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/07e524d3e955a79b94918d076642b3ac8e84b65f">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/07e524d3e955a79b94918d076642b3ac8e84b65f</a></li>

<li>Refactor client-side SSL certificate checking code. Separate the parts specific to the SSL library from the general logic. The previous code structure was open_client_SSL() calls verify_peer_name_matches_certificate() calls verify_peer_name_matches_certificate_name() calls wildcard_certificate_match() and was completely in fe-secure-openssl.c. The new structure is open_client_SSL() [openssl] calls pq_verify_peer_name_matches_certificate() [generic] calls pgtls_verify_peer_name_matches_certificate_guts() [openssl] calls openssl_verify_peer_name_matches_certificate_name() [openssl] calls pq_verify_peer_name_matches_certificate_name() [generic] calls wildcard_certificate_match() [generic] Move the generic functions into a new file fe-secure-common.c, so the calls generally go fe-connect.c -&gt; fe-secure.c -&gt; fe-secure-${impl}.c -&gt; fe-secure-common.c, although there is a bit of back-and-forth between the last two.

<li>Fix application of identity values in some cases. Investigation of 2d2d06b7e27e3177d5bef0061801c75946871db3 revealed that identity values were not applied in some further cases, including logical replication subscribers, VALUES RTEs, and ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN. To fix all that, apply the identity column expression in build_column_default() instead of repeating the same logic at each call site. For ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... IDENTITY, the previous coding completely ignored that existing rows for the new column should have values filled in from the identity sequence. The coding using build_column_default() fails for this because the sequence ownership isn't registered until after ALTER TABLE, and we can't do it before because we don't have the column in the catalog yet. So we specially remember in ColumnDef the sequence name that we decided on and build a custom NextValueExpr using that.

<li>Fix list partition constraints for partition keys of array type. The old code generated always generated a constraint of the form col = ANY(ARRAY[val1, val2, ...]), but that's invalid when col is an array type. Instead, generate col = val when there's only one value, col = val1 OR col = val2 OR ... when there are multiple values and col is of array type, and the old form when there are multiple values and col is not of an array type. As a side benefit, this makes constraint exclusion able to prune a list partition declared to accept a single Boolean value, which didn't work before.

<li>Add new function WaitForParallelWorkersToAttach. Once this function has been called, we know that all workers have started and attached to their error queues -- so if any of them subsequently exit uncleanly, we'll be sure to throw an ERROR promptly. Otherwise, users of the ParallelContext machinery must be careful not to wait forever for a worker that has failed to start. Parallel query manages to work without needing this for reasons explained in new comments added by this patch, but it's a useful primitive for other parallel operations, such as the pending patch to make creating a btree index run in parallel.

<li>Refactor code for partition bound searching. Remove partition_bound_cmp() and partition_bound_bsearch(), whose void * argument could be, depending on the situation, of any of three different types: PartitionBoundSpec *, PartitionRangeBound *, Datum *. Instead, introduce separate bound-searching functions for each situation: partition_list_bsearch, partition_range_bsearch, partition_range_datum_bsearch, and partition_hash_bsearch. This requires duplicating the code for binary search, but it makes the code much more type safe, involves fewer branches at runtime, and at least in my opinion, is much easier to understand. Along the way, add an option to partition_range_datum_bsearch allowing the number of keys to be specified, so that we can search for partitions based on a prefix of the full list of partition keys. This is important for pending work to improve partition pruning. Amit Langote, per a suggestion from me.

<li>Support parallel btree index builds. To make this work, tuplesort.c and logtape.c must also support parallelism, so this patch adds that infrastructure and then applies it to the particular case of parallel btree index builds. Testing to date shows that this can often be 2-3x faster than a serial index build. The model for deciding how many workers to use is fairly primitive at present, but it's better than not having the feature. We can refine it as we get more experience. Peter Geoghegan with some help from Rushabh Lathia. While Heikki Linnakangas is not an author of this patch, he wrote other patches without which this feature would not have been possible, and therefore the release notes should possibly credit him as an author of this feature. Reviewed by Claudio Freire, Heikki Linnakangas, Thomas Munro, Tels, Amit Kapila, me.
