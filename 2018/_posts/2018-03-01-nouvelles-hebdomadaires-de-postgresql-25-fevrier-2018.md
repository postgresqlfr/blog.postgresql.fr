<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<p>Peter Eisentraut pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Message style fix. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/97a804cb2bba49d5ff04795cf500722977e5af9a">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/97a804cb2bba49d5ff04795cf500722977e5af9a</a></li>

<li>Fix StaticAssertExpr() under C++. The previous code didn't compile, because static_assert() must end with a semicolon. To fix, wrap it in a block, similar to the C code. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ebf6049ebea19e4123fefce7b542189e84084cd1">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ebf6049ebea19e4123fefce7b542189e84084cd1</a></li>

<li>Remove redundant function declaration. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2e1d1ebdffa2c69779573c2e561056cd08541e74">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2e1d1ebdffa2c69779573c2e561056cd08541e74</a></li>

<li>Error message improvement. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c2ff42c6c1631c6c67d09fc8574186a984566a0d">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c2ff42c6c1631c6c67d09fc8574186a984566a0d</a></li>

<li>Update gratuitous use of MD5 in documentation. It seems some people are bothered by the outdated MD5 appearing in example code. So replace it with more modern alternatives or by a different example function. Reported-by: Jon Wolski &lt;jonwolski@gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/0db2fc98cdf4135f9dcfa3740db6f2548682fe7e">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/0db2fc98cdf4135f9dcfa3740db6f2548682fe7e</a></li>

<li>Add user-callable SHA-2 functions. Add the user-callable functions sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512. We already had these in the C code to support SCRAM, but there was no test coverage outside of the SCRAM tests. Adding these as user-callable functions allows writing some tests. Also, we have a user-callable md5 function but no more modern alternative, which led to wide use of md5 as a general-purpose hash function, which leads to occasional complaints about using md5. Also mark the existing md5 functions as leak-proof.

<li>Fix perlcritic warnings. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/abcba7001e481a565b8fba2393666dc54e90db61">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/abcba7001e481a565b8fba2393666dc54e90db61</a></li>

<li>Support parameters in CALL. To support parameters in CALL, move the parse analysis of the procedure and arguments into the global transformation phase, so that the parser hooks can be applied. And then at execution time pass the parameters from ProcessUtility on to ExecuteCallStmt. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/76b6aa41f41db66004b1c430f17a546d4102fbe7">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/76b6aa41f41db66004b1c430f17a546d4102fbe7</a></li>

<li>Fix filtering of unsupported relations in logical replication. In the pgoutput plugin, skip changes for relations that are not publishable, per is_publishable_class(). This concerns in particular materialized views and information_schema tables. While those relations cannot be part of a publication, per existing checks, they will be considered by a FOR ALL TABLES publication. A subscription would not actually apply changes for those relations, again per existing checks, but trying to match incoming changes to local tables on the subscriber would lead to errors if no matching local table exists. Skipping those changes on the publisher avoids sending useless changes and eliminates the error.

<li>Check error messages in SSL tests. In tests that check whether a connection fails, also check the error message. That makes sure that the connection was rejected for the right reason. This discovered that two tests had their connection failing for the wrong reason. One test failed because pg_hba.conf was not set up to allow that user, one test failed because the client key file did not have the right permissions. Fix those tests and add a new one that is really supposed to check the file permission issue.

<li>Add current directory to Perl include path. Recent Perl versions don't have the current directory in the module include path anymore, so we need to add it here explicitly to make these scripts continue to work. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9ee0573ef146ab37d7b85951f83e00bcbd305ff3">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9ee0573ef146ab37d7b85951f83e00bcbd305ff3</a></li>

<li>Update headers of generated files. The scripts were changed in c98c35cd084a25c6cf9b08c76de8b89facd75fe7, but the output files were not updated to reflect the script changes. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c4ba1bee68abe217e441fb81343e5f9e9e2a5353">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c4ba1bee68abe217e441fb81343e5f9e9e2a5353</a></li>

<ul>

<li>Remove redundant initialization of a local variable. In what was doubtless a typo, commit bf6c614a2 introduced a duplicate initialization of a local variable. This made Coverity unhappy, as well as pretty much anybody reading the code. We don't even have a real use for the local variable, so just remove it. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8c44802b6ed4846accb08e2ffe93040b8b42aae9">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8c44802b6ed4846accb08e2ffe93040b8b42aae9</a></li>

<li>Remove bogus "extern" annotations on function definitions. While this is not illegal C, project style is to put "extern" only on declarations not definitions. David Rowley Discussion: <a target="_blank" href="https://postgr.es/m/CAKJS1f9RKLWXcMBQhvDYhmsMEo+ALuNgA-NE+AX5Uoke9DJ2Xg@mail.gmail.com">https://postgr.es/m/CAKJS1f9RKLWXcMBQhvDYhmsMEo+ALuNgA-NE+AX5Uoke9DJ2Xg@mail.gmail.com</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/524d64ea8e3e49b4fda41ff9b2f048b697384058">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/524d64ea8e3e49b4fda41ff9b2f048b697384058</a></li>

<li>Fix misbehavior of CTE-used-in-a-subplan during EPQ rechecks. An updating query that reads a CTE within an InitPlan or SubPlan could get incorrect results if it updates rows that are concurrently being modified. This is caused by CteScanNext supposing that nothing inside its recursive ExecProcNode call could change which read pointer is selected in the CTE's shared tuplestore. While that's normally true because of scoping considerations, it can break down if an EPQ plan tree gets built during the call, because EvalPlanQualStart builds execution trees for all subplans whether they're going to be used during the recheck or not. And it seems like a pretty shaky assumption anyway, so let's just reselect our own read pointer here. Per bug #14870 from Andrei Gorita. This has been broken since CTEs were implemented, so back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Fix pg_dump's logic for eliding sequence limits that match the defaults. The previous coding here applied atoi() to strings that could represent values too large to fit in an int. If the overflowed value happened to match one of the cases it was looking for, it would drop that limit value from the output, leading to incorrect restoration of the sequence. Avoid the unsafe behavior, and also make the logic cleaner by explicitly calculating the default min/max values for the appropriate kind of sequence. Reported and patched by Alexey Bashtanov, though I whacked his patch around a bit. Back-patch to v10 where the faulty logic was added. Discussion: <a target="_blank" href="https://postgr.es/m/cb85a9a5-946b-c7c4-9cf2-6cd6e25d7a33@imap.cc">https://postgr.es/m/cb85a9a5-946b-c7c4-9cf2-6cd6e25d7a33@imap.cc</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3486bcf9e89d87b59d0e370af098fda38be97209">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3486bcf9e89d87b59d0e370af098fda38be97209</a></li>

<li>Repair pg_upgrade's failure to preserve relfrozenxid for matviews. This oversight led to data corruption in matviews, manifesting as "could not access status of transaction" before our most recent releases, and "found xmin from before relfrozenxid" errors since then. The proximate cause of the problem seems to have been confusion between the task of preserving dropped-column status and the task of preserving frozenxid status. Those are required for distinct sets of relkinds, and the reasoning was entirely undocumented in the source code. In hopes of forestalling future errors of the same kind, try to improve the commentary in this area. In passing, also improve the remarkably unhelpful comments around pg_upgrade's set_frozenxids(). That's not actually buggy AFAICS, but good luck figuring out what it does from the old comments. Per report from Claudio Freire. It appears that bug #14852 from Alexey Ermakov is an earlier report of the same issue, and there may be other cases that we failed to identify at the time. Patch by me based on analysis by Andres Freund. The bug dates back to the introduction of matviews, so back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Fix planner failures with overlapping mergejoin clauses in an outer join. Given overlapping or partially redundant join clauses, for example t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.x AND t1.b = t2.x the planner's EquivalenceClass machinery will ordinarily refactor the clauses as "t1.a = t1.b AND t1.a = t2.x", so that join processing doesn't see multiple references to the same EquivalenceClass in a list of join equality clauses. However, if the join is outer, it's incorrect to derive a restriction clause on the outer side from the join conditions, so the clause refactoring does not happen and we end up with overlapping join conditions. The code that attempted to deal with such cases had several subtle bugs, which could result in "left and right pathkeys do not match in mergejoin" or "outer pathkeys do not match mergeclauses" planner errors, if the selected join plan type was a mergejoin. (It does not appear that any actually incorrect plan could have been emitted.) The core of the problem really was failure to recognize that the outer and inner relations' pathkeys have different relationships to the mergeclause list. A join's mergeclause list is constructed by reference to the outer pathkeys, so it will always be ordered the same as the outer pathkeys, but this cannot be presumed true for the inner pathkeys. If the inner sides of the mergeclauses contain multiple references to the same EquivalenceClass ({t2.x} in the above example) then a simplistic rendering of the required inner sort order is like "ORDER BY t2.x, t2.x", but the pathkey machinery recognizes that the second sort column is redundant and throws it away. The mergejoin planning code failed to account for that behavior properly. One error was to try to generate cut-down versions of the mergeclause list from cut-down versions of the inner pathkeys in the same way as the initial construction of the mergeclause list from the outer pathkeys was done; this could lead to choosing a mergeclause list that fails to match the outer pathkeys. The other problem was that the pathkey cross-checking code in create_mergejoin_plan treated the inner and outer pathkey lists identically, whereas actually the expectations for them must be different. That led to false "pathkeys do not match" failures in some cases, and in principle could have led to failure to detect bogus plans in other cases, though there is no indication that such bogus plans could be generated. Reported by Alexander Kuzmenkov, who also reviewed this patch. This has been broken for years (back to around 8.3 according to my testing), so back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Allow auto_explain.log_min_duration to go up to INT_MAX. The previous limit of INT_MAX / 1000 seems to have been cargo-culted in from somewhere else. Or possibly the value was converted to microseconds at some point; but in all supported releases, it's just compared to other values, so there's no need for the restriction. This change raises the effective limit from ~35 minutes to ~24 days, which conceivably is useful to somebody, and anyway it's more consistent with the range of the core log_min_duration_statement GUC. Per complaint from Kevin Bloch. Back-patch to all supported releases.

<li>Fix brown-paper-bag bug in commit 0a459cec96d3856f476c2db298c6b52f592894e8. RANGE_OFFSET comparisons need to examine the first ORDER BY column, which isn't necessarily the first column in the incoming tuples. No idea how this slipped through initial testing.

<li>Add window RANGE support for float4, float8, numeric. Commit 0a459cec9 left this for later, but since time's running out, I went ahead and took care of it. There are more data types that somebody might someday want RANGE support for, but this is enough to satisfy all expectations of the SQL standard, which just says that "numeric, datetime, and interval" types should have RANGE support. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8b29e88cdce17705f0b2c43e50219ce1d7d2f603">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8b29e88cdce17705f0b2c43e50219ce1d7d2f603</a></li>

<li>Un-break parallel pg_upgrade. Commit b3f840120 changed pg_upgrade so that it'd actually drop and re-create the template1 and postgres databases in the new cluster. That works fine, serially. With the -j option it's not so fine, because other per-database jobs might be launched while the template1 database is dropped. Since they attempt to connect there to start up, kaboom. This is the cause of the intermittent failures buildfarm member jacana has been showing for the last month; evidently it is the only BF member configured to run the pg_upgrade test with parallelism enabled. Fix by processing template1 separately before we get into the parallel sub-job launch loop. (We could alternatively have made the postgres DB be the special case, but it seems likely that template1 will contain less stuff and so we lose less parallelism with this choice.) <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5b570d771b80aadc98755208f8f1b81e9a5eb366">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5b570d771b80aadc98755208f8f1b81e9a5eb366</a></li>

<li>Allow UNIQUE indexes on partitioned tables. If we restrict unique constraints on partitioned tables so that they must always include the partition key, then our standard approach to unique indexes already works --- each unique key is forced to exist within a single partition, so enforcing the unique restriction in each index individually is enough to have it enforced globally. Therefore we can implement unique indexes on partitions by simply removing a few restrictions (and adding others.)

<li>Use platform independent type for TupleTableSlot-&gt;tts_off. Previously tts_off was, for unknown reasons, of type long. For one that's unnecessary as tuples are restricted in length, for another long would be a bad choice of type even if that weren't the case, as it's not reliably wider than an int. Also HeapTupleHeader-&gt;t_len is a uint32. This is split off from a larger patch implementing JITed tuple deforming. Seems like an independent improvement, as tiny as it is.

<li>Blindly attempt to adapt sepgsql regression tests. Commit bf6c614a2f2c58312b3be34a47e7fb7362e07bcb broke the sepgsql test due to a new invocation of the function access hook during grouping equal initialization. The new behaviour seems at least as correct as the old one, so try adapt the tests. As I've no working sepgsql setup here, this is just going from buildfarm results.

<li>Charge cpu_tuple_cost * 0.5 for Append and MergeAppend nodes. Previously, Append didn't charge anything at all, and MergeAppend charged only cpu_operator_cost, about half the value used here. This change might make MergeAppend plans slightly more likely to be chosen than before, since this commit increases the assumed cost for Append -- with default values -- by 0.005 per tuple but MergeAppend by only 0.0025 per tuple. Since the comparisons required by MergeAppend are costed separately, it's not clear why MergeAppend needs to be otherwise more expensive than Append, so hopefully this is OK. Prior to partition-wise join, it didn't really matter whether or not an Append node had any cost of its own, because every plan had to use the same number of Append or MergeAppend nodes and in the same places. Only the relative cost of Append vs. MergeAppend made a difference. Now, however, it is possible to avoid some of the Append nodes using a partition-wise join, so it's worth making an effort. Pending patches for partition-wise aggregate care too, because an Append of Aggregate nodes will incur the Append overhead fewer times than an Aggregate over an Append. Although in most cases this change will favor the use of partition-wise techniques, it does the opposite when the join cardinality is greater than the sum of the input cardinalities. Since this situation arises in an existing regression test, I [rhaas] adjusted it to keep the overall plan shape approximately the same. Jeevan Chalke, per a suggestion from David Rowley.

<li>Try to stabilize EXPLAIN output in partition_check test. Commit 7d8ac9814bc9bb6df2d845dbabed38d7284c7c2c adjusted these tests in the hope of preserving the plan shape, but I failed to notice that the three partitions were, on my local machine, choosing two different plan shapes. This is probably related to the fact that all three tables have exactly the same row count. Try to improve the situation by making pht1_e about half as large as the other two.

<li>Be lazier about partition tuple routing. It's not necessary to fully initialize the executor data structures for partitions to which no tuples are ever routed. Consider, for example, an INSERT statement that inserts only one row: it only cares about the partition to which that one row is routed. The new function ExecInitPartitionInfo performs the initialization in question only when a particular partition is about to receive a tuple. This includes creating, validating, and saving a pointer to the ResultRelInfo, setting up for speculative insertions, translating WCOs and initializing the resulting expressions, translating returning lists and building the appropriate projection information, and setting up a tuple conversion map. One thing that's not deferred is locking the child partitions; that seems desirable but would need more thought. Still, testing shows that this makes single-row inserts significantly faster on a table with many partitions without harming the bulk-insert case.
