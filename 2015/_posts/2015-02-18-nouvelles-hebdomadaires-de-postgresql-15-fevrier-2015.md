<p><strong>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</strong></p>

<p>Fujii Masao a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Move pg_lzcompress.c to src/common. The meta data of PGLZ symbolized by PGLZ_Header is removed, to make the compression and decompression code independent on the backend-only varlena facility. PGLZ_Header is being used to store some meta data related to the data being compressed like the raw length of the uncompressed record or some varlena-related data, making it unpluggable once PGLZ is stored in src/common as it contains some backend-only code paths with the management of varlena structures. The APIs of PGLZ are reworked at the same time to do only compression and decompression of buffers without the meta-data layer, simplifying its use for a more general usage. On-disk format is preserved as well, so there is no incompatibility with previous major versions of PostgreSQL for TOAST entries. Exposing compression and decompression APIs of pglz makes possible its use by extensions and contrib modules. Especially this commit is required for upcoming WAL compression feature so that the WAL reader facility can decompress the WAL data by using pglz_decompress. Michael Paquier, reviewed by me.

<p>Heikki Linnakangas a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix MSVC build. When I moved pg_crc.c from src/port to src/common, I forgot to modify MSVC build script accordingly. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cc761b170c5e7b4ef22ed918f4785ec1fabe62cd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cc761b170c5e7b4ef22ed918f4785ec1fabe62cd</a></li>

<li>Move pg_crc.c to src/common, and remove pg_crc_tables.h. To get CRC functionality in a client program, you now need to link with libpgcommon instead of libpgport. The CRC code has nothing to do with portability, so libpgcommon is a better home. (libpgcommon didn't exist when pg_crc.c was originally moved to src/port.) Remove the possibility to get CRC functionality by just #including pg_crc_tables.h. I'm not aware of any extensions that actually did that and couldn't simply link with libpgcommon. This also moves the pg_crc.h header file from src/include/utils to src/include/common, which will require changes to any external programs that currently does #include "utils/pg_crc.h". That seems acceptable, as include/common is clearly the right home for it now, and the change needed to any such programs is trivial.

<li>Speed up CRC calculation using slicing-by-8 algorithm. This speeds up WAL generation and replay. The new algorithm is significantly faster with large inputs, like full-page images or when inserting wide rows. It is slower with tiny inputs, i.e. less than 10 bytes or so, but the speedup with longer inputs more than make up for that. Even small WAL records at least have 24 byte header in the front. The output is identical to the current byte-at-a-time computation, so this does not affect compatibility. The new algorithm is only used for the CRC-32C variant, not the legacy version used in tsquery or the "traditional" CRC-32 used in hstore and ltree. Those are not as performance critical, and are usually only applied over small inputs, so it seems better to not carry around the extra lookup tables to speed up those rare cases. Abhijit Menon-Sen 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/025c02420de990c15a90e9e3f86fcfbc5b59ee88">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/025c02420de990c15a90e9e3f86fcfbc5b59ee88</a></li>

<li>Simplify waiting logic in reading from / writing to client. The client socket is always in non-blocking mode, and if we actually want blocking behaviour, we emulate it by sleeping and retrying. But we have retry loops at different layers for reads and writes, which was confusing. To simplify, remove all the sleeping and retrying code from the lower levels, from be_tls_read and secure_raw_read and secure_raw_write, and put all the logic in secure_read() and secure_write(). 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/80788a431e9bff06314a054109fdea66ac538199">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/80788a431e9bff06314a054109fdea66ac538199</a></li>

<li>Simplify the way OpenSSL renegotiation is initiated in server. At least in all modern versions of OpenSSL, it is enough to call SSL_renegotiate() once, and then forget about it. Subsequent SSL_write() and SSL_read() calls will finish the handshake. The SSL_set_session_id_context() call is unnecessary too. We only have one SSL context, and the SSL session was created with that to begin with.

<li>Fix broken #ifdef for __sparcv8. Rob Rowan. Backpatch to all supported versions, like the patch that added the broken #ifdef.

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Minor cleanup/code review for "indirect toast" stuff. Fix some issues I noticed while fooling with an extension to allow an additional kind of toast pointer. Much of this is just comment improvement, but there are a couple of actual bugs, which might or might not be reachable today depending on what can happen during logical decoding. An example is that toast_flatten_tuple() failed to cover the possibility of an indirection pointer in its input. Back-patch to 9.4 just in case that is reachable now. In HEAD, also correct some really minor issues with recent compression reorganization, such as dangerously underparenthesized macros. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bc4de01db3a210e988dc88b585d7c38e6e7054c7">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bc4de01db3a210e988dc88b585d7c38e6e7054c7</a></li>

<li>Fix GEQO to not assume its join order heuristic always works. Back in commit 400e2c934457bef4bc3cc9a3e49b6289bd761bc0 I rewrote GEQO's gimme_tree function to improve its heuristic for modifying the given tour into a legal join order. In what can only be called a fit of hubris, I supposed that this new heuristic would *always* find a legal join order, and ripped out the old logic that allowed gimme_tree to sometimes fail. The folly of this is exposed by bug #12760, in which the "greedy" clumping behavior of merge_clump() can lead it into a dead end which could only be recovered from by un-clumping. We have no code for that and wouldn't know exactly what to do with it if we did. Rather than try to improve the heuristic rules still further, let's just recognize that it *is* a heuristic and probably must always have failure cases. So, put back the code removed in the previous commit to allow for failure (but comment it a bit better this time). It's possible that this code was actually fully correct at the time and has only been broken by the introduction of LATERAL. But having seen this example I no longer have much faith in that proposition, so back-patch to all supported branches. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1a179f36f7c612d3560a72396c559cd876dfab6b">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1a179f36f7c612d3560a72396c559cd876dfab6b</a></li>

<li>Fix pg_dump's heuristic for deciding which casts to dump. Back in 2003 we had a discussion about how to decide which casts to dump. At the time pg_dump really only considered an object's containing schema to decide what to dump (ie, dump whatever's not in pg_catalog), and so we chose a complicated idea involving whether the underlying types were to be dumped (cf commit a6790ce85752b67ad994f55fdf1a450262ccc32e). But users are allowed to create casts between built-in types, and we failed to dump such casts. Let's get rid of that heuristic, which has accreted even more ugliness since then, in favor of just looking at the cast's OID to decide if it's a built-in cast or not. In passing, also fix some really ancient code that supposed that it had to manufacture a dependency for the cast on its cast function; that's only true when dumping from a pre-7.3 server. This just resulted in some wasted cycles and duplicate dependency-list entries with newer servers, but we might as well improve it. Per gripes from a number of people, most recently Greg Sabino Mullane. Back-patch to all supported branches. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9feefedf9e92066fa6609d1e1e17b4892d81716f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9feefedf9e92066fa6609d1e1e17b4892d81716f</a></li>

<li>Fix more memory leaks in failure path in buildACLCommands. We already had one go at this issue in commit d73b7f973db5ec7e, but we failed to notice that buildACLCommands also leaked several PQExpBuffers along with a simply malloc'd string. This time let's try to make the fix a bit more future-proof by eliminating the separate exit path. It's still not exactly critical because pg_dump will curl up and die on failure; but since the amount of the potential leak is now several KB, it seems worth back-patching as far as 9.2 where the previous fix landed. Per Coverity, which evidently is smarter than clang's static analyzer. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9179444d070713f53a97bc8f5c898a8304424c4d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9179444d070713f53a97bc8f5c898a8304424c4d</a></li>

<li>Fix minor memory leak in ident_inet(). We'd leak the ident_serv data structure if the second pg_getaddrinfo_all (the one for the local address) failed. This is not of great consequence because a failure return here just leads directly to backend exit(), but if this function is going to try to clean up after itself at all, it should not have such holes in the logic. Try to fix it in a future-proof way by having all the failure exits go through the same cleanup path, rather than "optimizing" some of them. Per Coverity. Back-patch to 9.2, which is as far back as this patch applies cleanly. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/58146d35deed3bd3e05ce4b5ba529e4e4a369ddb">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/58146d35deed3bd3e05ce4b5ba529e4e4a369ddb</a></li>

<li>Fix missing PQclear() in libpqrcv_endstreaming(). This omission leaked one PGresult per WAL streaming cycle, which possibly would never be enough to notice in the real world, but it's still a leak. Per Coverity. Back-patch to 9.3 where the error was introduced. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4f38a281a3d4a7cbcf9de2f676d44336d57b7717">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4f38a281a3d4a7cbcf9de2f676d44336d57b7717</a></li>

<li>Avoid returning undefined bytes in chkpass_in(). We can't really fix the problem that the result is defined to depend on random(), so it is still going to fail the "unstable input conversion" test in parse_type.c. However, we can at least satify valgrind. (It looks like this code used to be valgrind-clean, actually, until somebody did a careless s/strncpy/strlcpy/g on it.) In passing, let's just make real sure that chkpass_out doesn't overrun its output buffer. No need for backpatch, I think, since this is just to satisfy debugging tools. Asif Naeem
