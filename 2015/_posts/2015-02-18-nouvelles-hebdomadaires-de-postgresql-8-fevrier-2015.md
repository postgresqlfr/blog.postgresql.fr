<li>doc: Improve claim about location of pg_service.conf. The previous wording claimed that the file was always in /etc, but of course this varies with the installation layout. Write instead that it can be found via `pg_config --sysconfdir`. Even though this is still somewhat incorrect because it doesn't account of moved installations, it at least conveys that the location depends on the installation.

<li>Fix breakage in GEODEBUG debug code. LINE doesn't have an "m" field (anymore anyway). Also fix unportable assumption that %x can print the result of pointer subtraction. In passing, improve single_decode() in minor ways: Remove unnecessary leading-whitespace skip (strtod does that already). Make GEODEBUG message more intelligible. Remove entirely-useless test to see if strtod returned a silly pointer. Don't bother computing trailing-whitespace skip unless caller wants an ending pointer. This has been broken since 261c7d4b653bc3e44c31fd456d94f292caa50d8f. Although it's only debug code, might as well fix the 9.4 branch too.

<li>Remove unused "m" field in LSEG. This field has been unreferenced since 1998, and does not appear in lseg values stored on disk (since sizeof(lseg) is only 32 bytes according to pg_type).

Remove it to (a) simplify matters and (b) suppress some uninitialized-field whining from Coverity.

<li>Check DCH_MAX_ITEM_SIZ limits with &lt;=, not &lt;. We reserve space for the full amount, not one less. The affected checks deal with localized month and day names. Today's DCH_MAX_ITEM_SIZ value would suffice for a 60-byte day name, while the longest known is the 49-byte mn_CN.utf-8 word for "Saturday." Thus, the upshot of this change is merely to avoid misdirecting future readers of the code; users are not expected to see errors either way.

<li>Add API functions to libpq to interrogate SSL related stuff. This makes it possible to query for things like the SSL version and cipher used, without depending on OpenSSL functions or macros. That is a good thing if we ever get another SSL implementation. PQgetssl() still works, but it should be considered as deprecated as it only works with OpenSSL. In particular, PQgetSslInUse() should be used to check if a connection uses SSL, because as soon as we have another implementation, PQgetssl() will return NULL even if SSL is in use.

<li>Fix reference-after-free when waiting for another xact due to constraint. If an insertion or update had to wait for another transaction to finish, because there was another insertion with conflicting key in progress, we would pass a just-free'd item pointer to XactLockTableWait(). All calls to XactLockTableWait() and MultiXactIdWait() had similar issues. Some passed a pointer to a buffer in the buffer cache, after already releasing the lock. The call in EvalPlanQualFetch had already released the pin too. All but the call in execUtils.c would merely lead to reporting a bogus ctid, however (or an assertion failure, if enabled). All the callers that passed HeapTuple-&gt;t_data-&gt;t_ctid were slightly bogus anyway: if the tuple was updated (again) in the same transaction, its ctid field would point to the next tuple in the chain, not the tuple itself. Backpatch to 9.4, where the 'ctid' argument to XactLockTableWait was added (in commit f88d4cfc)

<li>Use a separate memory context for GIN scan keys. It was getting tedious to track and release all the different things that form a scan key. We were leaking at least the queryCategories array, and possibly more, on a rescan. That was visible if a GIN index was used in a nested loop join. This also protects from leaks in extractQuery method. No backpatching, given the lack of complaints from the field. Maybe later, after this has received more field testing.

<li>Report WAL flush, not insert, position in replication IDENTIFY_SYSTEM. When beginning streaming replication, the client usually issues the IDENTIFY_SYSTEM command, which used to return the current WAL insert position. That's not suitable for the intended purpose of that field, however. pg_receivexlog uses it to start replication from the reported point, but if it hasn't been flushed to disk yet, it will fail. Change IDENTIFY_SYSTEM to report the flush position instead. Backpatch to 9.1 and above. 9.0 doesn't report any WAL position.

<li>Be more careful to not lose sync in the FE/BE protocol. If any error occurred while we were in the middle of reading a protocol message from the client, we could lose sync, and incorrectly try to interpret a part of another message as a new protocol message. That will usually lead to an "invalid frontend message" error that terminates the connection. However, this is a security issue because an attacker might be able to deliberately cause an error, inject a Query message in what's supposed to be just user data, and have the server execute it. We were quite careful to not have CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() calls or other operations that could ereport(ERROR) in the middle of processing a message, but a query cancel interrupt or statement timeout could nevertheless cause it to happen. Also, the V2 fastpath and COPY handling were not so careful. It's very difficult to recover in the V2 COPY protocol, so we will just terminate the connection on error. In practice, that's what happened previously anyway, as we lost protocol sync. To fix, add a new variable in pqcomm.c, PqCommReadingMsg, that is set whenever we're in the middle of reading a message. When it's set, we cannot safely ERROR out and continue running, because we might've read only part of a message. PqCommReadingMsg acts somewhat similarly to critical sections in that if an error occurs while it's set, the error handler will force the connection to be terminated, as if the error was FATAL. It's not implemented by promoting ERROR to FATAL in elog.c, like ERROR is promoted to PANIC in critical sections, because we want to be able to use PG_TRY/CATCH to recover and regain protocol sync. pq_getmessage() takes advantage of that to prevent an OOM error from terminating the connection. To prevent unnecessary connection terminations, add a holdoff mechanism similar to HOLD/RESUME_INTERRUPTS() that can be used hold off query cancel interrupts, but still allow die interrupts. The rules on which interrupts are processed when are now a bit more complicated, so refactor ProcessInterrupts() and the calls to it in signal handlers so that the signal handlers always call it if ImmediateInterruptOK is set, and ProcessInterrupts() can decide to not do anything if the other conditions are not met. Reported by Emil Lenngren. Patch reviewed by Noah Misch and Andres Freund. Backpatch to all supported versions. Security: CVE-2015-0244

<li>Use a nonblocking socket for FE/BE communication and block using latches. This allows to introduce more elaborate handling of interrupts while reading from a socket. Currently some interrupt handlers have to do significant work from inside signal handlers, and it's very hard to correctly write code to do so. Generic signal handler limitations, combined with the fact that we can't safely jump out of a signal handler while reading from the client have prohibited implementation of features like timeouts for idle-in-transaction. Additionally we use the latch code to wait in a couple places where we previously only had waiting code on windows as other platforms just busy looped. This can increase the number of systemcalls happening during FE/BE communication. Benchmarks so far indicate that the impact isn't very high, and there's room for optimization in the latch code. The chance of cleaning up the usage of latches gives us, seem to outweigh the risk of small performance regressions. This commit theoretically can't used without the next patch in the series, as WaitLatchOrSocket is not defined to be fully signal safe. As we already do that in some cases though, it seems better to keep the commits separate, so they're easier to understand. Author: Andres Freund Reviewed-By: Heikki Linnakangas

<li>Introduce and use infrastructure for interrupt processing during client reads. Up to now large swathes of backend code ran inside signal handlers while reading commands from the client, to allow for speedy reaction to asynchronous events. Most prominently shared invalidation and NOTIFY handling. That means that complex code like the starting/stopping of transactions is run in signal handlers... The required code was fragile and verbose, and is likely to contain bugs. That approach also severely limited what could be done while communicating with the client. As the read might be from within openssl it wasn't safely possible to trigger an error, e.g. to cancel a backend in idle-in-transaction state. We did that in some cases, namely fatal errors, nonetheless. Now that FE/BE communication in the backend employs non-blocking sockets and latches to block, we can quite simply interrupt reads from signal handlers by setting the latch. That allows us to signal an interrupted read, which is supposed to be retried after returning from within the ssl library. As signal handlers now only need to set the latch to guarantee timely interrupt processing, remove a fair amount of complicated &amp; fragile code from async.c and sinval.c. We could now actually start to process some kinds of interrupts, like sinval ones, more often that before, but that seems better done separately. This work will hopefully allow to handle cases like being blocked by sending data, interrupting idle transactions and similar to be implemented without too much effort. In addition to allowing getting rid of ImmediateInterruptOK, that is. Author: Andres Freund Reviewed-By: Heikki Linnakangas

<li>Process 'die' interrupts while reading/writing from the client socket. Up to now it was impossible to terminate a backend that was trying to send/recv data to/from the client when the socket's buffer was already full/empty. While the send/recv calls itself might have gotten interrupted by signals on some platforms, we just immediately retried. That could lead to situations where a backend couldn't be terminated , after a client died without the connection being closed, because it was blocked in send/recv. The problem was far more likely to be hit when sending data than when reading. That's because while reading a command from the client, and during authentication, we processed interrupts immediately . That primarily left COPY FROM STDIN as being problematic for recv. Change things so that that we process 'die' events immediately when the appropriate signal arrives. We can't sensibly react to query cancels at that point, because we might loose sync with the client as we could be in the middle of writing a message. We don't interrupt writes if the write buffer isn't full, as indicated by write() returning EWOULDBLOCK, as that would lead to fewer error messages reaching clients.

<li>Don't allow immediate interrupts during authentication anymore. We used to handle authentication_timeout by setting ImmediateInterruptOK to true during large parts of the authentication phase of a new connection. While that happens to work acceptably in practice, it's not particularly nice and has ugly corner cases. Previous commits converted the FE/BE communication to use latches and implemented support for interrupt handling during both send/recv. Building on top of that work we can get rid of ImmediateInterruptOK during authentication, by immediately treating timeouts during authentication as a reason to die. As die interrupts are handled immediately during client communication that provides a sensibly quick reaction time to authentication timeout. Additionally add a few CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() to some more complex authentication methods. More could be added, but this already should provides a reasonable coverage. While it this overall increases the maximum time till a timeout is reacted to, it greatly reduces complexity and increases reliability. That seems like a overall win. If the increase proves to be noticeable we can deal with those cases by moving to nonblocking network code and add interrupt checking there. Reviewed-By: Heikki Linnakangas

<li>Move deadlock and other interrupt handling in proc.c out of signal handlers. Deadlock checking was performed inside signal handlers up to now. While it's a remarkable feat to have made this work reliably, it's quite complex to understand why that is the case. Partially it worked due to the assumption that semaphores are signal safe - which is not actually documented to be the case for sysv semaphores. The reason we had to rely on performing this work inside signal handlers is that semaphores aren't guaranteed to be interruptable by signals on all platforms. But now that latches provide a somewhat similar API, which actually has the guarantee of being interruptible, we can avoid doing so. Signalling between ProcSleep, ProcWakeup, ProcWaitForSignal and ProcSendSignal is now done using latches. This increases the likelihood of spurious wakeups. As spurious wakeup already were possible and aren't likely to be frequent enough to be an actual problem, this seems acceptable. This change would allow for further simplification of the deadlock checking, now that it doesn't have to run in a signal handler. But even if I were motivated to do so right now, it would still be better to do that separately. Such a cleanup shouldn't have to be reviewed a the same time as the more fundamental changes in this commit. There is one possible usability regression due to this commit. Namely it is more likely than before that log_lock_waits messages are output more than once. Reviewed-By: Heikki Linnakangas

<li>This routine was calling ecpg_alloc to allocate to memory but did not actually check the returned pointer allocated, potentially NULL which could be the result of a malloc call. Issue noted by Coverity, fixed by Michael Paquier &lt;michael@otacoo.com&gt;

<li>to_char(): prevent writing beyond the allocated buffer. Previously very long localized month and weekday strings could overflow the allocated buffers, causing a server crash. Reported and patch reviewed by Noah Misch. Backpatch to all supported versions. Security: CVE-2015-0241

<li>to_char(): prevent accesses beyond the allocated buffer. Previously very long field masks for floats could access memory beyond the existing buffer allocated to hold the result. Reported by Andres Freund and Peter Geoghegan. Backpatch to all supported versions. Security: CVE-2015-0241

<li>port/snprintf(): fix overflow and do padding. Prevent port/snprintf() from overflowing its local fixed-size buffer and pad to the desired number of digits with zeros, even if the precision is beyond the ability of the native sprintf(). port/snprintf() is only used on systems that lack a native snprintf(). Reported by Bruce Momjian. Patch by Tom Lane. Backpatch to all supported versions. Security: CVE-2015-0242
