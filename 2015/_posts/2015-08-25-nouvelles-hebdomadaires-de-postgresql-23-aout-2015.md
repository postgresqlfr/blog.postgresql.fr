<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<ul>

<li>Fix reporting of skipped transactions in pgbench. Broken by commit 1bc90f7a. Fabien Coelho. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/0e8efed59e7f98f237e90fba20364165f7cc9ba9">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/0e8efed59e7f98f237e90fba20364165f7cc9ba9</a></li>

<li>Add hint to run "pgbench -i", if test tables don't exist. Fabien Coelho, reviewed by Julien Rouhaud <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e7b90c52b3ee440f63445ba8f83419fd713069cf">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e7b90c52b3ee440f63445ba8f83419fd713069cf</a></li>

<li>Improve configure test for the sse4.2 crc instruction. With optimizations enabled at least one compiler, clang 3.7, optimized away the crc intrinsics knowing that the result went on unused and has no side effects. That can trigger errors in code generation when the intrinsic is used, as we chose to use the intrinsics without any additional compiler flag. Return the computed value to prevent that. With some more pedantic warning flags (-Wold-style-definition) the configure test failed to recognize the existence of _mm_crc32_u* intrinsics due to an independent warning in the test because the test turned on -Werror, but that's not actually needed here. Discussion: 20150814092039.GH4955@awork2.anarazel.de Backpatch: 9.5, where the use of crc intrinsics was integrated. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6cf72879e944f32b5b8232541cccd575de797fa4">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6cf72879e944f32b5b8232541cccd575de797fa4</a></li>

<li>Fix performance bug from conflict between two previous improvements. My expanded-objects patch (commit 1dc5ebc9077ab742) included code to make plpgsql pass expanded-object variables as R/W pointers to certain functions that are trusted for modifying such variables in-place. However, that optimization got broken by commit 6c82d8d1fdb1f126, which arranged to share a single ParamListInfo across most expressions evaluated by a plpgsql function. We don't want a R/W pointer to be passed to other functions just because we decided one function was safe! Fortunately, the breakage was in the other direction, of never passing a R/W pointer at all, because we'd always have pre-initialized the shared array slot with a R/O pointer. So it was still functionally correct, but we were back to O(N^2) performance for repeated use of "a := a || x". To fix, force an unshared param array to be used when the R/W param optimization is active. Commit 6c82d8d1fdb1f126 is in HEAD only, so no need for a back-patch. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d3eaab3ef0d552a2f6555b0424a32dc9e77fb17c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d3eaab3ef0d552a2f6555b0424a32dc9e77fb17c</a></li>

<li>Fix a few bogus statement type names in plpgsql error messages. plpgsql's error location context messages ("PL/pgSQL function fn-name line line-no at stmt-type") would misreport a CONTINUE statement as being an EXIT, and misreport a MOVE statement as being a FETCH. These are clear bugs that have been there a long time, so back-patch to all supported branches. In addition, in 9.5 and HEAD, change the description of EXECUTE from "EXECUTE statement" to just plain EXECUTE; there seems no good reason why this statement type should be described differently from others that have a well-defined head keyword. And distinguish GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS from plain GET DIAGNOSTICS. These are a bit more of a judgment call, and also affect existing regression-test outputs, so I did not back-patch into stable branches. Pavel Stehule and Tom Lane <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2edb9491155ad70e57b5d18f2aa0d8d5a09386cd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2edb9491155ad70e57b5d18f2aa0d8d5a09386cd</a></li>

<li>Remove xpath namespace-handling change from 9.5 release notes. Although commit 79af9a1d2 was initially applied to HEAD only, we later back-patched the change into all branches (commits 6bbf75192 et al). So it's not a new behavior in 9.5 and should not be release-noted here. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a93545e13f832d457e00420d44ccce1f88f899d4">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a93545e13f832d457e00420d44ccce1f88f899d4</a></li>

<li>Allow record_in() and record_recv() to work for transient record types. If we have the typmod that identifies a registered record type, there's no reason that record_in() should refuse to perform input conversion for it. Now, in direct SQL usage, record_in() will always be passed typmod = -1 with type OID RECORDOID, because no typmodin exists for type RECORD, so the case can't arise. However, some InputFunctionCall users such as PLs may be able to supply the right typmod, so we should allow this to support them. Note: the previous coding and comment here predate commit 59c016aa9f490b53. There has been no case since 8.1 in which the passed type OID wouldn't be valid; and if it weren't, this error message wouldn't be apropos anyway. Better to let lookup_rowtype_tupdesc complain about it. Back-patch to 9.1, as this is necessary for my upcoming plpython fix. I'm committing it separately just to make it a bit more visible in the commit history. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/09b3d27256d26e258c7802cfd8fea06d81b0a62c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/09b3d27256d26e258c7802cfd8fea06d81b0a62c</a></li>

<li>Fix plpython crash when returning string representation of a RECORD result. PLyString_ToComposite() blithely overwrote proc-&gt;result.out.d, even though for a composite result type the other union variant proc-&gt;result.out.r is the one that should be valid. This could result in a crash if out.r had in fact been filled in (proc-&gt;result.is_rowtype == 1) and then somebody later attempted to use that data; as per bug #13579 from Pawe&Aring;&sbquo; Michalak. Just to add insult to injury, it didn't work for RECORD results anyway, because record_in() would refuse the case. Fix by doing the I/O function lookup in a local PLyTypeInfo variable, as we were doing already in PLyObject_ToComposite(). This is not a great technique because any fn_extra data allocated by the input function will be leaked permanently (thanks to using TopMemoryContext as fn_mcxt). But that's a pre-existing issue that is much less serious than a crash, so leave it to be fixed separately. This bug would be a potential security issue, except that plpython is only available to superusers and the crash requires coding the function in a way that didn't work before today's patches. Add regression test cases covering all the supported methods of converting composite results. Back-patch to 9.1 where the faulty coding was introduced. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f469f634ad7338b7eab046238354f07930fb6bca">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f469f634ad7338b7eab046238354f07930fb6bca</a></li>

<li>Detect mismatched CONTINUE and EXIT statements at plpgsql compile time. With a bit of tweaking of the compile namestack data structure, we can verify at compile time whether a CONTINUE or EXIT is legal. This is surely better than leaving it to runtime, both because earlier is better and because we can issue a proper error pointer. Also, we can get rid of the ad-hoc old way of detecting the problem, which only took care of CONTINUE not EXIT. Jim Nasby, adjusted a bit by me <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fcdfce6820373422bcdb5630f9eb63df14fd0764">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fcdfce6820373422bcdb5630f9eb63df14fd0764</a></li>

<li>Avoid O(N^2) behavior when enlarging SPI tuple table in spi_printtup(). For no obvious reason, spi_printtup() was coded to enlarge the tuple pointer table by just 256 slots at a time, rather than doubling the size at each reallocation, as is our usual habit. For very large SPI results, this makes for O(N^2) time spent in repalloc(), which of course soon comes to dominate the runtime. Use the standard doubling approach instead. This is a longstanding performance bug, so back-patch to all active branches. Neil Conway <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6e5d9f278c1209936d973930996857f55e119cd8">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6e5d9f278c1209936d973930996857f55e119cd8</a></li>

<li>Avoid use of float arithmetic in bipartite_match.c. Since the distances used in this algorithm are small integers (not more than the size of the U set, in fact), there is no good reason to use float arithmetic for them. Use short ints instead: they're smaller, faster, and require no special portability assumptions. Per testing by Greg Stark, which disclosed that the code got into an infinite loop on VAX for lack of IEEE-style float infinities. We don't really care all that much whether Postgres can run on a VAX anymore, but there seems sufficient reason to change this code anyway. In passing, make a few other small adjustments to make the code match usual Postgres coding style a bit better. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/44ed65a545970829322098e22d10947e6d545d9a">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/44ed65a545970829322098e22d10947e6d545d9a</a></li>

<li>Reduce number of bytes examined by convert_one_string_to_scalar(). Previously, convert_one_string_to_scalar() would examine up to 20 bytes of the input string, producing a scalar conversion with theoretical precision far greater than is of any possible use considering the other limitations on the accuracy of the resulting selectivity estimate. (I think this choice might pre-date the caller-level logic that strips any common prefix of the strings; before that, there could have been value in scanning the strings far enough to use all the precision available in a double.) Aside from wasting cycles to little purpose, this choice meant that the "denom" variable could grow to as much as 256^21 = 3.74e50, which could overflow in some non-IEEE float arithmetics. While we don't really support any machines with non-IEEE arithmetic anymore, this still seems like quite an unnecessary platform dependency. Limit the scan to 12 bytes instead, thus limiting "denom" to 256^13 = 2.03e31, a value more likely to be computable everywhere. Per testing by Greg Stark, which showed overflow failures in our standard regression tests on VAX. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/aad663a0b4af785d0b245bbded27537f23932839">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/aad663a0b4af785d0b245bbded27537f23932839</a></li>

<li>Fix bug in calculations of hash join buckets. Commit 8cce08f168481c5fc5be4e7e29b968e314f1b41e used a left-shift on a literal of 1 that could (in large allocations) be shifted by 31 or more bits. This was assigned to a local variable that was already declared to be a long to protect against overruns of int, but the literal in this shift needs to be declared long to allow it to work correctly in some compilers. Backpatch to 9.5, where the bug was introduced. Report and patch by KaiGai Kohei, slighly modified based on discussion. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1cac8c98201cb0ed1a3592cf355a2670d3771689">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1cac8c98201cb0ed1a3592cf355a2670d3771689</a></li>

<li>Rename 'cmd' to 'cmd_name' in CreatePolicyStmt. To avoid confusion, rename CreatePolicyStmt's 'cmd' to 'cmd_name', parse_policy_command's 'cmd' to 'polcmd', and AlterPolicy's 'cmd_datum' to 'polcmd_datum', per discussion with Noah and as a follow-up to his correction of copynodes/equalnodes handling of the CreatePolicyStmt 'cmd' field. Back-patch to 9.5 where the CreatePolicyStmt was introduced, as we are still only in alpha. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3c99788797e8269ac19c7c8e3fb99dd9613646ea">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3c99788797e8269ac19c7c8e3fb99dd9613646ea</a></li>

<li>In AlterRole, make bypassrls an int. When reworking bypassrls in AlterRole to operate the same way the other attribute handling is done, I missed that the variable was incorrectly a bool rather than an int. This meant that on platforms with an unsigned char, we could end up with incorrect behavior during ALTER ROLE. Pointed out by Andres thanks to tests he did changing our bool to be the one from stdbool.h which showed this and a number of other issues. Add regression tests to test CREATE/ALTER role for the various role attributes. Arrange to leave roles behind for testing pg_dumpall, but none which have the LOGIN attribute. Back-patch to 9.5 where the AlterRole bug exists. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7ec8296e70f0f03cbdb3e0eb4f05ad5be0f810c8">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7ec8296e70f0f03cbdb3e0eb4f05ad5be0f810c8</a></li>

<li>Clean up roles from roleattributes test. Having the roles remain after the test ends up causing repeated 'make installcheck' runs to fail and may be risky from a security perspective also, so remove them at the end of the test. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/072710dff3eef4540f1c64d07890eb128535e212">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/072710dff3eef4540f1c64d07890eb128535e212</a></li>

<li>Remove ExecGetScanType function. This became unused in a191a169d6d0b9558da4519e66510c4540204a51. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8c3d63c521a28c2224aefbdc28ae7e24e81a0156">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8c3d63c521a28c2224aefbdc28ae7e24e81a0156</a></li>

<li>Do not allow *timestamp to be passed as NULL. The code had bugs that would cause crashes if NULL was passed as that argument (originally intended to mean not to bother returning its value), and after inspection it turns out that nothing seems interested in the case that *ts is NULL anyway. Therefore, remove the partial checks intended to support that case. Author: Michael Paquier though I didn't include a proposed Assert. Backpatch to 9.5. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e68be16b0d0e857bc05949b8ee78c5aaf7d8954a">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e68be16b0d0e857bc05949b8ee78c5aaf7d8954a</a></li>
