<li>Call xlc __isync() after, not before, associated compare-and-swap. Architecture reference material specifies this order, and s_lock.h inline assembly agrees. The former order failed to provide mutual exclusion to lwlock.c and perhaps to other clients.

<li>Make concurrent refresh check early that there is a unique index on matview. In REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW command, CONCURRENTLY option is only allowed if there is at least one unique index with no WHERE clause on one or more columns of the matview. Previously, concurrent refresh checked the existence of a unique index on the matview after filling the data to new snapshot, i.e., after calling refresh_matview_datafill(). So, when there was no unique index, we could need to wait a long time before we detected that and got the error. It was a waste of time. To eliminate such wasting time, this commit changes concurrent refresh so that it checks the existence of a unique index at the beginning of the refresh operation, i.e., before starting any time-consuming jobs. If CONCURRENTLY option is not allowed due to lack of a unique index, concurrent refresh can immediately detect it and emit an error.

<li>Correct the formulas for System V IPC parameters SEMMNI and SEMMNS in docs. In runtime.sgml, the old formulas for calculating the reasonable values of SEMMNI and SEMMNS were incorrect. They have forgotten to count the number of semaphores which both the checkpointer process (introduced in 9.2) and the background worker processes (introduced in 9.3) need. This commit fixes those formulas so that they count the number of semaphores which the checkpointer process and the background worker processes need. Report and patch by Kyotaro Horiguchi.

<li>Correct Copyright year from 2015 to 2016. Looks like this patch went in after Copyright messages were updated for 2016 and it missed the boat.

<li>Move DATA entry to correct position. In commit 7b4bfc87 the DATA and DESCR entries for the new row_security_active() function were inadvertantly put after the PROVOLATILE defines, rather than before as they should have been placed. Move them up where they belong.

<li>Revert inadvertant change in pg_config behavior. In commit a5c43b88 the behavior of command line pg_config was inadvertantly changed to include the config name when specific configs are requested, similar to when none are requested and all are emitted. This breaks scripts that expect to use pg_config for e.g. PGXS.

<li>Allow SetHintBits() to succeed if the buffer's LSN is new enough. Previously we only allowed SetHintBits() to succeed if the commit LSN of the last transaction touching the page has already been flushed to disk. We can't generally change the LSN of the page, because we don't necessarily have the required locks on the page. But the required LSN interlock does not mean the commit record has to be flushed immediately, it just requires that the commit record will be flushed before the page is written out. Therefore if the buffer LSN is newer than the commit LSN, the hint bit can be safely set. In a number of scenarios (e.g. pgbench) this noticeably increases the number of hint bits are set. But more importantly it also keeps the success rate up when flushing WAL less frequently. That was the original reason for commit 4de82f7d7, which has negative performance consequences in a number of scenarios. This will allow a followup commit to reduce the flush rate. Discussion: 20160118163908.GW10941@awork2.anarazel.de <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/db76b1efbbab2441428a9ef21f7ac9ba43c52482">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/db76b1efbbab2441428a9ef21f7ac9ba43c52482</a></li>

<li>Allow the WAL writer to flush WAL at a reduced rate. Commit 4de82f7d7 increased the WAL flush rate, mainly to increase the likelihood that hint bits can be set quickly. More quickly set hint bits can reduce contention around the clog et al. But unfortunately the increased flush rate can have a significant negative performance impact, I have measured up to a factor of ~4. The reason for this slowdown is that if there are independent writes to the underlying devices, for example because shared buffers is a lot smaller than the hot data set, or because a checkpoint is ongoing, the fdatasync() calls force cache flushes to be emitted to the storage. This is achieved by flushing WAL only if the last flush was longer than wal_writer_delay ago, or if more than wal_writer_flush_after (new GUC) unflushed blocks are pending. Based on some tests the default for wal_writer_delay is 1MB, which seems to work well both on SSD and rotational media. To avoid negative performance impact due to 4de82f7d7 an earlier commit (db76b1e) made SetHintBits() more likely to succeed; preventing performance regressions in the pgbench tests I performed.

<li>Suppress compiler warnings about useless comparison of unsigned to zero. Reportedly, some compilers warn about tests like "c &lt; 0" if c is unsigned, and hence complain about the character range checks I added in commit 3bb3f42f3749d40b8d4de65871e8d828b18d4a45. This is a bit of a pain since the regex library doesn't really want to assume that chr is unsigned. However, since any such reconfiguration would involve manual edits of regcustom.h anyway, we can put it on the shoulders of whoever wants to do that to adjust this new range-checking macro correctly. Per gripes from Coverity and Andres. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8c95ae81fab11b75a611b57d6aaa0ef77e8b8e41">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8c95ae81fab11b75a611b57d6aaa0ef77e8b8e41</a></li>

<li>Improve documentation about CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY. Clarify the description of which transactions will block a CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY command from proceeding, and mention that the index might still not be usable after CREATE INDEX completes. (This happens if the index build detected broken HOT chains, so that pg_index.indcheckxmin gets set, and there are open old transactions preventing the xmin horizon from advancing past the index's initial creation. I didn't want to explain what broken HOT chains are, though, so I omitted an explanation of exactly when old transactions prevent the index from being used.) Per discussion with Chris Travers. Back-patch to all supported branches, since the same text appears in all of them. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a65313f28bfc264573a066271a11172d109dc2c4">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a65313f28bfc264573a066271a11172d109dc2c4</a></li>

<li>Make plpython cope with funny characters in function names. A function name that's double-quoted in SQL can contain almost any characters, but we were using that name directly as part of the name generated for the Python-level function, and Python doesn't like anything that isn't pretty much a standard identifier. To fix, replace anything that isn't an ASCII letter or digit with an underscore in the generated name. This doesn't create any risk of duplicate Python function names because we were already appending the function OID to the generated name to ensure uniqueness. Per bug #13960 from Jim Nasby. Patch by Jim Nasby, modified a bit by me. Back-patch to all supported branches. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/66f503868b2ac1163aaf48a2f76d8be02af0bc81">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/66f503868b2ac1163aaf48a2f76d8be02af0bc81</a></li>

<li>Fix multiple bugs in contrib/pgstattuple's pgstatindex() function. Dead or half-dead index leaf pages were incorrectly reported as live, as a consequence of a code rearrangement I made (during a moment of severe brain fade, evidently) in commit d287818eb514d431. The index metapage was not counted in index_size, causing that result to not agree with the actual index size on-disk. Index root pages were not counted in internal_pages, which is inconsistent compared to the case of a root that's also a leaf (one-page index), where the root would be counted in leaf_pages. Aside from that inconsistency, this could lead to additional transient discrepancies between the reported page counts and index_size, since it's possible for pgstatindex's scan to see zero or multiple pages marked as BTP_ROOT, if the root moves due to a split during the scan. With these fixes, index_size will always be exactly one page more than the sum of the displayed page counts. Also, the index_size result was incorrectly documented as being measured in pages; it's always been measured in bytes. (While fixing that, I couldn't resist doing some small additional wordsmithing on the pgstattuple docs.) Including the metapage causes the reported index_size to not be zero for an empty index. To preserve the desired property that the pgstattuple regression test results are platform-independent (ie, BLCKSZ configuration independent), scale the index_size result in the regression tests. The documentation issue was reported by Otsuka Kenji, and the inconsistent root page counting by Peter Geoghegan; the other problems noted by me. Back-patch to all supported branches, because this has been broken for a long time. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/48e6c943e5f11f5d80cabdbcd98f79e3dbad1988">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/48e6c943e5f11f5d80cabdbcd98f79e3dbad1988</a></li>

<li>Add an explicit representation of the output targetlist to Paths. Up to now, there's been an assumption that all Paths for a given relation compute the same output column set (targetlist). However, there are good reasons to remove that assumption. For example, an indexscan on an expression index might be able to return the value of an expensive function "for free". While we have the ability to generate such a plan today in simple cases, we don't have a way to model that it's cheaper than a plan that computes the function from scratch, nor a way to create such a plan in join cases (where the function computation would normally happen at the topmost join node). Also, we need this so that we can have Paths representing post-scan/join steps, where the targetlist may well change from one step to the next. Therefore, invent a "struct PathTarget" representing the columns we expect a plan step to emit. It's convenient to include the output tuple width and tlist evaluation cost in this struct, and there will likely be additional fields in future. While Path nodes that actually do have custom outputs will need their own PathTargets, it will still be true that most Paths for a given relation will compute the same tlist. To reduce the overhead added by this patch, keep a "default PathTarget" in RelOptInfo, and allow Paths that compute that column set to just point to their parent RelOptInfo's reltarget. (In the patch as committed, actually every Path is like that, since we do not yet have any cases of custom PathTargets.) I took this opportunity to provide some more-honest costing of PlaceHolderVar evaluation. Up to now, the assumption that "scan/join reltargetlists have cost zero" was applied not only to Vars, where it's reasonable, but also PlaceHolderVars where it isn't. Now, we add the eval cost of a PlaceHolderVar's expression to the first plan level where it can be computed, by including it in the PathTarget cost field and adding that to the cost estimates for Paths. This isn't perfect yet but it's much better than before, and there is a way forward to improve it more. This costing change affects the join order chosen for a couple of the regression tests, changing expected row ordering. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/19a541143a09c067ec8cac77ec6a64eb5b1b662b">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/19a541143a09c067ec8cac77ec6a64eb5b1b662b</a></li>

<li>Cosmetic improvements in new config_info code. Coverity griped about use of unchecked strcpy() into a local variable. There's unlikely to be any actual bug there, since no caller would be passing a path longer than MAXPGPATH, but nonetheless use of strlcpy() seems preferable. While at it, get rid of unmaintainable separation between list of field names and list of field values in favor of initializing them in parallel. And we might as well declare get_configdata()'s path argument as const char *, even though no current caller needs that. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c7a1c5a6b6aa4bbc2c9619edc94368fccc1c8c8e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c7a1c5a6b6aa4bbc2c9619edc94368fccc1c8c8e</a></li>

<li>Docs: make prose discussion match the ordering of Table 9-58. The "Session Information Functions" table seems to be sorted mostly alphabetically (although it's not perfect), which would be all right if it didn't lead to some related functions being described in a pretty nonintuitive order. Also, the prose discussions after the table were in an order that hardly matched the table at all. Rearrange to make things a bit easier to follow. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/64a169d1313d6b99b48c2d270df121ef43c03269">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/64a169d1313d6b99b48c2d270df121ef43c03269</a></li>

<li>pgbench: avoid FD_ISSET on an invalid file descriptor The original code wasn't careful to test the file descriptor returned by PQsocket() for an invalid socket. If an invalid socket did turn up, that would amount to calling FD_ISSET with fd = -1, whereby undefined behavior can be invoked. To fix, test file descriptor for validity and stop further processing if that fails. Problem noticed by Coverity. There is an existing FD_ISSET callsite that does check for invalid sockets beforehand, but the error message reported by it was strerror(errno); in testing the aforementioned change, that turns out to result in "bad socket: Success" which isn't terribly helpful. Instead use PQerrorMessage() in both places which is more likely to contain an useful error message.

Not all compilers support "long long" and the "LL" integer literal suffix, so use a cast to int64 instead. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/740d71842b8e0e798c80f4f841227b6de81b5f43">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/740d71842b8e0e798c80f4f841227b6de81b5f43</a></li>

<li>Add pg_size_bytes() to parse human-readable size strings. This will parse strings in the format produced by pg_size_pretty() and return sizes in bytes. This allows queries to be written with clauses like "pg_total_relation_size(oid) &gt; pg_size_bytes('10 GB')".

<li>Fix pg_size_bytes() to be more portable. Commit 53874c5228fe16589a4d01b3e1fab3678e0fd8e3 broke various 32-bit buildfarm machines because it incorrectly used an 'L' suffix for what needed to be a 64-bit literal. Thanks to Michael Paquier for helping to diagnose this. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ad7cc1c554980145b226a066afe56d9c777ce7ae">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ad7cc1c554980145b226a066afe56d9c777ce7ae</a></li>

<li>Fix two-argument jsonb_object when called with empty arrays Some over-eager copy-and-pasting on my part resulted in a nonsense result being returned in this case. I have adopted the same pattern for handling this case as is used in the one argument form of the function, i.e. we just skip over the code that adds values to the object. Diagnosis and patch from Michael Paquier, although not quite his solution. Fixes bug #13936. Backpatch to 9.5 where jsonb_object was introduced. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/94c745eb189e2122a3ff86c24443b11408ea2376">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/94c745eb189e2122a3ff86c24443b11408ea2376</a></li>
