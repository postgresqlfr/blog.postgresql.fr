<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<p>Tom Lane pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Revert "Add some temporary code to record stack usage at server process exit." This reverts commit 88cf37d2a86d5b66380003d7c3384530e3f91e40 as well as follow-on commits ea9c4a16d5ad88a1d28d43ef458e3209b53eb106 and c57562725d219c4249b82f4a4fb5aaeee3ae0d53. We've learned about as much as we can from the buildfarm. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/96112ee7c60557bb192a9aa07b514db2400fd45e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/96112ee7c60557bb192a9aa07b514db2400fd45e</a></li>

<li>Improve output of psql's \df+ command. Add display of proparallel (parallel-safety) when the server is &gt;= 9.6, and display of proacl (access privileges) for all server versions. Minor tweak of column ordering to keep related columns together. Michael Paquier Discussion: &lt;CAB7nPqTR3Vu3xKOZOYqSm-+bSZV0kqgeGAXD6w5GLbkbfd5Q6w@mail.gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a670c24c382693c4f75e99c9292b2ed0f0d40a72">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a670c24c382693c4f75e99c9292b2ed0f0d40a72</a></li>

<li>Print a given subplan only once in EXPLAIN. We have, for a very long time, allowed the same subplan (same member of the PlannedStmt.subplans list) to be referenced by more than one SubPlan node; this avoids problems for cases such as subplans within an IndexScan's indxqual and indxqualorig fields. However, EXPLAIN had not gotten the memo and would print each reference as though it were an independent identical subplan. To fix, track plan_ids of subplans we've printed and don't print the same plan_id twice. Per report from Pavel Stehule. BTW: the particular case of IndexScan didn't cause visible duplication in a plain EXPLAIN, only EXPLAIN ANALYZE, because in the former case we short-circuit executor startup before the indxqual field is processed by ExecInitExpr. That seems like it could easily lead to other EXPLAIN problems in future, but it's not clear how to avoid it without breaking the "EXPLAIN a plan using hypothetical indexes" use-case. For now I've left that issue alone. Although this is a longstanding bug, it's purely cosmetic (no great harm is done by the repeat printout) and we haven't had field complaints before. So I'm hesitant to back-patch it, especially since there is some small risk of ABI problems due to the need to add a new field to ExplainState. In passing, rearrange order of fields in ExplainState to be less random, and update some obsolete comments about when/where to initialize them. Report: &lt;CAFj8pRAimq+NK-menjt+3J4-LFoodDD8Or6=Lc_stcFD+eD4DA@mail.gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4d042999f94a4bc41b86baca5920cd4829e16895">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4d042999f94a4bc41b86baca5920cd4829e16895</a></li>

<li>Allow IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA within pl/pgsql. Since IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA has an INTO clause, pl/pgsql needs to be aware of that and avoid capturing the INTO as an INTO-variables clause. This isn't hard, though it's annoying to have to make IMPORT a plpgsql keyword just for this. (Fortunately, we have the infrastructure now to make it an unreserved keyword, so at least this shouldn't break any existing pl/pgsql code.) Per report from Merlin Moncure. Back-patch to 9.5 where IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA was introduced. Report: &lt;CAHyXU0wpHf2bbtKGL1gtUEFATCY86r=VKxfcACVcTMQ70mCyig@mail.gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/baebab3ace480477f210dadc4633d8d119dfa978">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/baebab3ace480477f210dadc4633d8d119dfa978</a></li>

<li>Fix obsolete header-file reference in pg_buffercache docs. Commit 2d0019049 moved enum ForkNumber from relfilenode.h into relpath.h, but missed updating this documentation reference. Alexander Law <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/91c0eb5040cde36a62a34e9b3a80d82db64eb98f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/91c0eb5040cde36a62a34e9b3a80d82db64eb98f</a></li>

<li>Add a regression test case to improve code coverage for tuplesort. Test the external-sort code path in CLUSTER for two different scenarios: multiple-pass external sorting, and the best case for replacement selection, where only one run is produced, so that no merge is required. This test would have caught the bug fixed in commit 1b0fc8507, at least when run with valgrind enabled. In passing, add a short-circuit test in plan_cluster_use_sort() to make dead certain that it selects sorting when enable_indexscan is off. As things stand, that would happen anyway, but it seems like good future proofing for this test. Peter Geoghegan Discussion: &lt;CAM3SWZSgxehDkDMq1FdiW2A0Dxc79wH0hz1x-TnGy=1BXEL+nw@mail.gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cec55013943d160538334ee19ef5db429a085969">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cec55013943d160538334ee19ef5db429a085969</a></li>

<li>Minor test adjustment. Dept of second thoughts: given the RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION that was just added by commit cec550139, we don't need the reconnection that used to be here. Might as well buy back a few microseconds. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/56a997413391337f7fb9926144d6b6fa831b9d22">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/56a997413391337f7fb9926144d6b6fa831b9d22</a></li>

<li>Fix GiST index build for NaN values in geometric types. GiST index build could go into an infinite loop when presented with boxes (or points, circles or polygons) containing NaN component values. This happened essentially because the code assumed that x == x is true for any "double" value x; but it's not true for NaNs. The looping behavior was not the only problem though: we also attempted to sort the items using simple double comparisons. Since NaNs violate the trichotomy law, qsort could (in principle at least) get arbitrarily confused and mess up the sorting of ordinary values as well as NaNs. And we based splitting choices on box size calculations that could produce NaNs, again resulting in undesirable behavior. To fix, replace all comparisons of doubles in this logic with float8_cmp_internal, which is NaN-aware and is careful to sort NaNs consistently, higher than any non-NaN. Also rearrange the box size calculation to not produce NaNs; instead it should produce an infinity for a box with NaN on one side and not-NaN on the other. I don't by any means claim that this solves all problems with NaNs in geometric values, but it should at least make GiST index insertion work reliably with such data. It's likely that the index search side of things still needs some work, and probably regular geometric operations too. But with this patch we're laying down a convention for how such cases ought to behave. Per bug #14238 from Guang-Dih Lei. Back-patch to 9.2; the code used before commit 7f3bd86843e5aad8 is quite different and doesn't lock up on my simple test case, nor on the submitter's dataset. Report: &lt;20160708151747.1426.60150@wrigleys.postgresql.org&gt; Discussion: &lt;28685.1468246504@sss.pgh.pa.us&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1acf7572554515b99ef6e783750aaea8777524ec">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1acf7572554515b99ef6e783750aaea8777524ec</a></li>

<li>Improve documentation about search_path for SECURITY DEFINER functions. Clarify that the reason for recommending that pg_temp be put last is to prevent temporary tables from capturing unqualified table names. Per discussion with Albe Laurenz. Discussion: &lt;A737B7A37273E048B164557ADEF4A58B5386C6E1@ntex2010i.host.magwien.gv.at&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ce150e7e0fc1a127fee7933d71f4204a79ecce04">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ce150e7e0fc1a127fee7933d71f4204a79ecce04</a></li>

<li>Avoid invalidating all foreign-join cached plans when user mappings change. We must not push down a foreign join when the foreign tables involved should be accessed under different user mappings. Previously we tried to enforce that rule literally during planning, but that meant that the resulting plans were dependent on the current contents of the pg_user_mapping catalog, and we had to blow away all cached plans containing any remote join when anything at all changed in pg_user_mapping. This could have been improved somewhat, but the fact that a syscache inval callback has very limited info about what changed made it hard to do better within that design. Instead, let's change the planner to not consider user mappings per se, but to allow a foreign join if both RTEs have the same checkAsUser value. If they do, then they necessarily will use the same user mapping at runtime, and we don't need to know specifically which one that is. Post-plan-time changes in pg_user_mapping no longer require any plan invalidation. This rule does give up some optimization ability, to wit where two foreign table references come from views with different owners or one's from a view and one's directly in the query, but nonetheless the same user mapping would have applied. We'll sacrifice the first case, but to not regress more than we have to in the second case, allow a foreign join involving both zero and nonzero checkAsUser values if the nonzero one is the same as the prevailing effective userID. In that case, mark the plan as only runnable by that userID. The plancache code already had a notion of plans being userID-specific, in order to support RLS. It was a little confused though, in particular lacking clarity of thought as to whether it was the rewritten query or just the finished plan that's dependent on the userID. Rearrange that code so that it's clearer what depends on which, and so that the same logic applies to both RLS-injected role dependency and foreign-join-injected role dependency. Note that this patch doesn't remove the other issue mentioned in the original complaint, which is that while we'll reliably stop using a foreign join if it's disallowed in a new context, we might fail to start using a foreign join if it's now allowed, but we previously created a generic cached plan that didn't use one. It was agreed that the chance of winning that way was not high enough to justify the much larger number of plan invalidations that would have to occur if we tried to cause it to happen. In passing, clean up randomly-varying spelling of EXPLAIN commands in postgres_fdw.sql, and fix a COSTS ON example that had been allowed to leak into the committed tests. This reverts most of commits fbe5a3fb7 and 5d4171d1c, which were the previous attempt at ensuring we wouldn't push down foreign joins that span permissions contexts. Etsuro Fujita and Tom Lane Discussion: &lt;d49c1e5b-f059-20f4-c132-e9752ee0113e@lab.ntt.co.jp&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/45639a0525a58a2700cf46d4c934d6de78349dac">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/45639a0525a58a2700cf46d4c934d6de78349dac</a></li>

<li>Advance PG_CONTROL_VERSION. This should have been done in commit 73c986adde5d73a5 which added several new fields to pg_control, and again in commit 5028f22f6eb05798 which changed the CRC algorithm, but it wasn't. It's far too late to fix it in the 9.5 branch, but let's do so in 9.6, so that if a 9.6 postmaster is started against a 9.4-era pg_control it will complain about a versioning problem rather than a CRC failure. We already forced initdb/pg_upgrade for beta3, so there's no downside to doing this now. Discussion: &lt;7615.1468598094@sss.pgh.pa.us&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/99dd8b05aa5647a59f30ca67e67e2e3377f50094">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/99dd8b05aa5647a59f30ca67e67e2e3377f50094</a></li>

<li>Clarify usage of clientcert authentication option. For some reason this option wasn't discussed at all in client-auth.sgml. Document it there, and be more explicit about its relationship to the "cert" authentication method. Per gripe from Srikanth Venkatesh. I failed to resist the temptation to do some minor wordsmithing in the same area, too. Discussion: &lt;20160713110357.1410.30407@wrigleys.postgresql.org&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/745513c70282180afd83c666e43bdb0b6fb8c688">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/745513c70282180afd83c666e43bdb0b6fb8c688</a></li>

<li>Fix crash in close_ps() for NaN input coordinates. The Assert() here seems unreasonably optimistic. Andreas Seltenreich found that it could fail with NaNs in the input geometries, and it seems likely to me that it might fail in corner cases due to roundoff error, even for ordinary input values. As a band-aid, make the function return SQL NULL instead of crashing. Report: &lt;87d1md1xji.fsf@credativ.de&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/278148907a971ec7fa4ffb24248103d8012155d2">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/278148907a971ec7fa4ffb24248103d8012155d2</a></li>

<li>Add regression test case exercising the sorting path for hash index build. We've broken this code path at least twice in the past, so it's prudent to have a test case that covers it. To allow exercising the code path without creating a very large (and slow to run) test case, redefine the sort threshold to be bounded by maintenance_work_mem as well as the number of available buffers. While at it, fix an ancient oversight that when building a temp index, the number of available buffers is not NBuffers but NLocBuffer. Also, if assertions are enabled, apply a direct test that the sort actually does return the tuples in the expected order. Peter Geoghegan Patch: &lt;CAM3SWZTBAo4hjbBd780+MrOKiKp_TMo1N3A0Rw9_im8gbD7fQA@mail.gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9563d5b5e4c75e676d73a45546bd47b77c2bd739">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9563d5b5e4c75e676d73a45546bd47b77c2bd739</a></li>

<li>Improve test case exercising the sorting path for hash index build. On second thought, we should probably do at least a minimal check that the constructed index is valid, since the big problem with the most recent breakage was not whether the sorting was correct but that the index had incorrect hash codes placed in it. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/606ccc5e7e97914073f991b077712645e125d531">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/606ccc5e7e97914073f991b077712645e125d531</a></li>

<li>Fix nested NOT operation cleanup in tsquery. During normalization of tsquery tree it tries to simplify nested NOT operations but there it's obvioulsy missed that subsequent node could be a leaf node (value node) Bug #14245: Segfault on weird to_tsquery Reported by David Kellum. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/19d290155d084754eeb5ebb2569654da06073ee8">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/19d290155d084754eeb5ebb2569654da06073ee8</a></li>

<li>Fix parsing NOT sequence in tsquery Digging around bug #14245 I found that commit 6734a1cacd44f5b731933cbc93182b135b167d0c missed that NOT operation is right associative in opposite to all other. This miss is resposible for tsquery parser fail on sequence of NOT operations <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/00f304ce2dd86f4b76606225b41e0854a3362628">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/00f304ce2dd86f4b76606225b41e0854a3362628</a></li>

<li>Avoid serializability errors when locking a tuple with a committed update. When key-share locking a tuple that has been not-key-updated, and the update is a committed transaction, in some cases we raised serializability errors: ERROR: could not serialize access due to concurrent update Because the key-share doesn't conflict with the update, the error is unnecessary and inconsistent with the case that the update hasn't committed yet. This causes problems for some usage patterns, even if it can be claimed that it's sufficient to retry the aborted transaction: given a steady stream of updating transactions and a long locking transaction, the long transaction can be starved indefinitely despite multiple retries. To fix, we recognize that HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate can return HeapTupleUpdated when an updating transaction has committed, and that we need to deal with that case exactly as if it were a non-committed update: verify whether the two operations conflict, and if not, carry on normally. If they do conflict, however, there is a difference: in the HeapTupleBeingUpdated case we can just sleep until the concurrent transaction is gone, while in the HeapTupleUpdated case this is not possible and we must raise an error instead. Per trouble report from Olivier Dony. In addition to a couple of test cases that verify the changed behavior, I added a test case to verify the behavior that remains unchanged, namely that errors are raised when a update that modifies the key is used. That must still generate serializability errors. One pre-existing test case changes behavior; per discussion, the new behavior is actually the desired one.

<li>Make HEAP_LOCK/HEAP2_LOCK_UPDATED replay reset HEAP_XMAX_INVALID. 0ac5ad5 started to compress infomask bits in WAL records. Unfortunately the replay routines for XLOG_HEAP_LOCK/XLOG_HEAP2_LOCK_UPDATED forgot to reset the HEAP_XMAX_INVALID (and some other) hint bits. Luckily that's not problematic in the majority of cases, because after a crash/on a standby row locks aren't meaningful. Unfortunately that does not hold true in the presence of prepared transactions. This means that after a crash, or after promotion, row level locks held by a prepared, but not yet committed, prepared transaction might not be enforced. Discussion: 20160715192319.ubfuzim4zv3rqnxv@alap3.anarazel.de Backpatch: 9.3, the oldest branch on which 0ac5ad5 is present. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a4d357bfbd56bd876817fb74f46525dbb3184bc2">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a4d357bfbd56bd876817fb74f46525dbb3184bc2</a></li>

<li>Fix torn-page, unlogged xid and further risks from heap_update(). When heap_update needs to look for a page for the new tuple version, because the current one doesn't have sufficient free space, or when columns have to be processed by the tuple toaster, it has to release the lock on the old page during that. Otherwise there'd be lock ordering and lock nesting issues. To avoid concurrent sessions from trying to update / delete / lock the tuple while the page's content lock is released, the tuple's xmax is set to the current session's xid. That unfortunately was done without any WAL logging, thereby violating the rule that no XIDs may appear on disk, without an according WAL record. If the database were to crash / fail over when the page level lock is released, and some activity lead to the page being written out to disk, the xid could end up being reused; potentially leading to the row becoming invisible. There might be additional risks by not having t_ctid point at the tuple itself, without having set the appropriate lock infomask fields. To fix, compute the appropriate xmax/infomask combination for locking the tuple, and perform WAL logging using the existing XLOG_HEAP_LOCK record. That allows the fix to be backpatched. This issue has existed for a long time. There appears to have been partial attempts at preventing dangers, but these never have fully been implemented, and were removed a long time ago, in 11919160 (cf. HEAP_XMAX_UNLOGGED). In master / 9.6, there's an additional issue, namely that the visibilitymap's freeze bit isn't reset at that point yet. Since that's a new issue, introduced only in a892234f830, that'll be fixed in a separate commit. Author: Masahiko Sawada and Andres Freund.
