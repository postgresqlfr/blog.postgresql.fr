<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<p>Tom Lane pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Simplify the process of perltidy'ing our Perl files. Wrap the perltidy invocation into a shell script to reduce the risk of copy-and-paste errors. Include removal of *.bak files in the script, so they don't accidentally get committed. Improve the directions in the README file. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/05d8dec690e9719ff9a1830f5492864104275b5e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/05d8dec690e9719ff9a1830f5492864104275b5e</a></li>

<li>Final pgindent + perltidy run for 9.6. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b5bce6c1ec6061c8a4f730d927e162db7e2ce365">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b5bce6c1ec6061c8a4f730d927e162db7e2ce365</a></li>

<li>Stamp HEAD as 10devel. This is a good bit more complicated than the average new-version stamping commit, because it includes various adjustments in pursuit of changing from three-part to two-part version numbers. It's likely some further work will be needed around that change; but this is enough to get through the regression tests, at least in Unix builds. Peter Eisentraut and Tom Lane <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ca9112a424ff68ec4f2ef67b47122f7d61412964">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ca9112a424ff68ec4f2ef67b47122f7d61412964</a></li>

<li>Stamp shared-library minor version numbers for v10. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/0b9358d4406b9b45a06855d53f491cc7ce9550a9">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/0b9358d4406b9b45a06855d53f491cc7ce9550a9</a></li>

<li>Update git_changelog to know that there's a 9.6 branch. Missed this in the main 10devel version stamping patch. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3149a12166120d0b476f5ca7837ebcf0e7124703">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3149a12166120d0b476f5ca7837ebcf0e7124703</a></li>

<li>Allow .so minor version numbers above 9 in .gitignore. Needed now that libpq.so's minor version has reached 10. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2bf06f756142f4c398270cdc30bbba9b9dfbd38b">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2bf06f756142f4c398270cdc30bbba9b9dfbd38b</a></li>

<li>Doc: remove out-of-date claim that pg_am rows must be inserted by hand. Commit 473b93287 added a sentence about that, but neglected to remove the adjacent sentence it had falsified. Per Alexander Law. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8fc571b7dd9fa1659536a26bb085584b50a65a51">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8fc571b7dd9fa1659536a26bb085584b50a65a51</a></li>

<li>Doc: copy-editing in create_access_method.sgml. Improve shaky English grammar. And markup. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9b002cc9fec557fcfe17d67f55b53804447230e5">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9b002cc9fec557fcfe17d67f55b53804447230e5</a></li>

<li>Remove separate version numbering for ecpg preprocessor. Once upon a time, it made sense for the ecpg preprocessor to have its own version number, because it used a manually-maintained grammar that wasn't always in sync with the core grammar. But those days are thankfully long gone, leaving only a maintenance nuisance behind. Let's use the PG v10 version numbering changeover as an excuse to get rid of the ecpg version number and just have ecpg identify itself by PG_VERSION. From the user's standpoint, ecpg will go from "4.12" in the 9.6 branch to "10" in the 10 branch, so there's no failure of monotonicity. Discussion: &lt;1471332659.4410.67.camel@postgresql.org&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a7b5573d665c8a37fad9bc69f44c5b4e8760a73b">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a7b5573d665c8a37fad9bc69f44c5b4e8760a73b</a></li>

<li>Automate the maintenance of SO_MINOR_VERSION for our shared libraries. Up to now we've manually adjusted these numbers in several different Makefiles at the start of each development cycle. While that's not much work, it's easily forgotten, so let's get rid of it by setting the SO_MINOR_VERSION values directly from $(MAJORVERSION). In the case of libpq, this dev cycle's value of SO_MINOR_VERSION happens to be "10" anyway, so this switch is transparent. For ecpg's shared libraries, this will result in skipping one or two minor version numbers between v9.6 and v10, which seems like no big problem; and it was a bit inconsistent that they didn't have equal minor version numbers anyway. Discussion: &lt;21969.1471287988@sss.pgh.pa.us&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a3bce17ef1ca6408e8d1e7b10fb767aef1729be6">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a3bce17ef1ca6408e8d1e7b10fb767aef1729be6</a></li>

<li>Fix assorted places in psql to print version numbers &gt;= 10 in new style. This is somewhat cosmetic, since as long as you know what you are looking at, "10.0" is a serviceable substitute for "10". But there is a potential for confusion between version numbers with minor numbers and those without --- we don't want people asking "why is psql saying 10.0 when my server is 10.2". Therefore, back-patch as far as practical, which turns out to be 9.3. I could have redone the patch to use fprintf(stderr) in place of psql_error(), but it seems more work than is warranted for branches that will be EOL or nearly so by the time v10 comes out. Although only psql seems to contain any code that needs this, I chose to put the support function into fe_utils, since it seems likely we'll need it in other client programs in future. (In 9.3-9.5, use dumputils.c, the predecessor of fe_utils/string_utils.c.) In HEAD, also fix the backend code that whines about loadable-library version mismatch. I don't see much need to back-patch that. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7f61fd10ceb715eceece49451f6dfe9058044e15">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7f61fd10ceb715eceece49451f6dfe9058044e15</a></li>

<li>Suppress -Wunused-result warning for strtol(). I'm not sure which bozo thought it's a problem to use strtol() only for its endptr result, but silence the warning using same method used elsewhere. Report: &lt;f845d3a6-5328-3e2a-924f-f8e91aa2b6d2@2ndquadrant.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4bc4cfe3bd186b4a1d1b01279bfd0e6ab11268b2">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4bc4cfe3bd186b4a1d1b01279bfd0e6ab11268b2</a></li>

<li>Improve parsetree representation of special functions such as CURRENT_DATE. We implement a dozen or so parameterless functions that the SQL standard defines special syntax for. Up to now, that was done by converting them into more or less ad-hoc constructs such as "'now'::text::date". That's messy for multiple reasons: it exposes what should be implementation details to users, and performance is worse than it needs to be in several cases. To improve matters, invent a new expression node type SQLValueFunction that can represent any of these parameterless functions. Bump catversion because this changes stored parsetrees for rules. Discussion: &lt;30058.1463091294@sss.pgh.pa.us&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/0bb51aa96783e8a6c473c2b5e3725e23e95db834">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/0bb51aa96783e8a6c473c2b5e3725e23e95db834</a></li>

<li>Improve plpgsql's memory management to fix some function-lifespan leaks. In some cases, exiting out of a plpgsql statement due to an error, then catching the error in a surrounding exception block, led to leakage of temporary data the statement was working with, because we kept all such data in the function-lifespan SPI Proc context. Iterating such behavior many times within one function call thus led to noticeable memory bloat. To fix, create an additional memory context meant to have statement lifespan. Since many plpgsql statements, particularly the simpler/more common ones, don't need this, create it only on demand. Reset this context at the end of any statement that uses it, and arrange for exception cleanup to reset it too, thereby fixing the memory-leak issue. Allow a stack of such contexts to exist to handle cases where a compound statement needs statement-lifespan data that persists across calls of inner statements. While at it, clean up code and improve comments referring to the existing short-term memory context, which by plpgsql convention is the per-tuple context of the eval_econtext ExprContext. We now uniformly refer to that as the eval_mcontext, whereas the new statement-lifespan memory contexts are called stmt_mcontext. This change adds some context-creation overhead, but on the other hand it allows removal of some retail pfree's in favor of context resets. On balance it seems to be about a wash performance-wise. In principle this is a bug fix, but it seems too invasive for a back-patch, and the infrequency of complaints weighs against taking the risk in the back branches. So we'll fix it only in HEAD, at least for now. Tom Lane, reviewed by Pavel Stehule Discussion: &lt;17863.1469142152@sss.pgh.pa.us&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bfaaacc805aef9f07b4805c6a274256340b9cddf">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bfaaacc805aef9f07b4805c6a274256340b9cddf</a></li>

<li>Fix -e option in contrib/intarray/bench/bench.pl. As implemented, -e ran an EXPLAIN but then discarded the output, which certainly seems pointless. Make it print to stdout instead. It's been like that forever, so back-patch to all supported branches. Daniel Gustafsson, reviewed by Andreas Scherbaum. Patch: &lt;B97BDCB7-A3B3-4734-90B5-EDD586941629@yesql.se&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6657acc0100ec79304b868a6346db4d8eb2f6b83">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6657acc0100ec79304b868a6346db4d8eb2f6b83</a></li>

<li>Implement regexp_match(), a simplified alternative to regexp_matches(). regexp_match() is like regexp_matches(), but it disallows the 'g' flag and in consequence does not need to return a set. Instead, it returns a simple text array value, or NULL if there's no match. Previously people usually got that behavior with a sub-select, but this way is considerably more efficient. Documentation adjusted so that regexp_match() is presented first and then regexp_matches() is introduced as a more complicated version. This is a bit historically revisionist but seems pedagogically better. Still TODO: extend contrib/citext to support this function. Emre Hasegeli, reviewed by David Johnston Discussion: &lt;CAE2gYzy42sna2ME_e3y1KLQ-4UBrB-eVF0SWn8QG39sQSeVhEw@mail.gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cf9b0fea5f6d1bcc9b2c66f5c30ecb04684a0919">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cf9b0fea5f6d1bcc9b2c66f5c30ecb04684a0919</a></li>

<li>Support the new regexp_match() function for citext. Emre Hasegeli Patch: &lt;CAE2gYzzF24ZHWqkMukkHwqa0otbES9Rex22LrjQUNbi=oKziNQ@mail.gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f9d747a4e908ad09520cad4c0e8c915074e9964c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f9d747a4e908ad09520cad4c0e8c915074e9964c</a></li>

<li>Improve psql's tab completion for ALTER EXTENSION foo UPDATE ... Offer a list of available versions for that extension. Formerly, since there was no special support for this, it triggered off the UPDATE keyword and offered a list of table names --- not too helpful. Jeff Janes, reviewed by Gerdan Santos Patch: &lt;CAMkU=1z0gxEOLg2BWa69P4X4Ot8xBxipGUiGkXe_tC+raj79-Q@mail.gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/49917dbd76ba0b4179a82fcf033ef5a10b8e3488">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/49917dbd76ba0b4179a82fcf033ef5a10b8e3488</a></li>

<li>Improve psql's tab completion for \l. Offer a list of database names; formerly no help was offered. Ian Barwick, reviewed by Gerdan Santos Patch: &lt;5724132E.1030804@2ndquadrant.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8019b5a89c3cefbaa69ab58c00281419f7e46601">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8019b5a89c3cefbaa69ab58c00281419f7e46601</a></li>

<li>In plpgsql, don't try to convert int2vector or oidvector to expanded array. These types are storage-compatible with real arrays, but they don't support toasting, so of course they can't support expansion either. Per bug #14289 from Michael Overmeyer. Back-patch to 9.5 where expanded arrays were introduced. Report: &lt;20160818174414.1529.37913@wrigleys.postgresql.org&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5697522d8411135d26a5d807f9e4afa182502f64">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5697522d8411135d26a5d807f9e4afa182502f64</a></li>

<li>Update line count totals for psql help displays. As usual, we've been pretty awful about maintaining these counts. They're not all that critical, perhaps, but let's get them right at release time. Also fix 9.5, which I notice is just as bad. It's probably wrong further back, but the lack of --help=foo options before 9.5 makes it too painful to count. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c5d4f40cb5e231eb2cbc533b5f094f3a4829e2ef">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c5d4f40cb5e231eb2cbc533b5f094f3a4829e2ef</a></li>

<li>Remove typedef celt from the regex library, along with macro NOCELT. The regex library used to have a notion of a "collating element" that was distinct from a "character", but Henry Spencer never actually implemented his planned support for multi-character collating elements, and the Tcl crew ripped out most of the stubs for that years ago. The only thing left that distinguished the "celt" typedef from the "chr" typedef was that "celt" was supposed to also be able to hold the not-a-character "NOCELT" value. However, NOCELT was not used anywhere after the MCCE stub removal changes, which means there's no need for celt to be different from chr. Removing the separate typedef simplifies matters and also removes a trap for the unwary, in that celt is signed while chr may not be, so comparisons could mean different things. There's no bug there today because we restrict CHR_MAX to be less than INT_MAX, but I think there may have been such bugs before we did that, and there could be again if anyone ever decides to fool with the range of chr. This patch also removes assorted unnecessary casts to "chr" of values that are already chrs. Many of these seem to be leftover from days when the code was compatible with pre-ANSI C. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6eefd2422ef232aec2fe12465d9ec4018c63814d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6eefd2422ef232aec2fe12465d9ec4018c63814d</a></li>

<li>Clean up another pre-ANSI-C-ism in regex code: get rid of pcolor typedef. pcolor was used to represent function arguments that are nominally of type color, but when using a pre-ANSI C compiler would be passed as the promoted integer type. We really don't need that anymore. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a859e640035680db31531ccd19a67292dd726baf">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a859e640035680db31531ccd19a67292dd726baf</a></li>

<li>Speed up planner's scanning for parallel-query hazards. We need to scan the whole parse tree for parallel-unsafe functions. If there are none, we'll later need to determine whether particular subtrees contain any parallel-restricted functions. The previous coding retained no knowledge from the first scan, even though this is very wasteful in the common case where the query contains only parallel-safe functions. We can bypass all of the later scans by remembering that fact. This provides a small but measurable speed improvement when the case applies, and shouldn't cost anything when it doesn't. Patch by me, reviewed by Robert Haas Discussion: &lt;3740.1471538387@sss.pgh.pa.us&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/da1c91631e3577ea5818f855ebb5bd206d559006">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/da1c91631e3577ea5818f855ebb5bd206d559006</a></li>

<li>Guard against parallel-restricted functions in VALUES expressions. Obvious brain fade in set_rel_consider_parallel(). Noticed it while adjusting the adjacent RTE_FUNCTION case. In 9.6, also make the code look more like what I just did in HEAD by removing the unnecessary function_rte_parallel_ok subroutine (it does nothing that expression_tree_walker wouldn't do). <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/65a603e90328a7a8fb3ab30ed96f24bf8eb4cf84">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/65a603e90328a7a8fb3ab30ed96f24bf8eb4cf84</a></li>

<li>Use LEFT JOINs in some system views in case referenced row doesn't exist. In particular, left join to pg_authid so that rows in pg_stat_activity don't disappear if the session's owning user has been dropped. Also convert a few joins to pg_database to left joins, in the same spirit, though that case might be harder to hit. We were doing this in other views already, so it was a bit inconsistent that these views didn't. Oskari Saarenmaa, with some further tweaking by me Discussion: &lt;56E87CD8.60007@ohmu.fi&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8299471c37fff0b0f5a777a12f920125310c0efe">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8299471c37fff0b0f5a777a12f920125310c0efe</a></li>

<li>Allow empty queries in pgbench. This might have been too much of a foot-gun before 9.6, but with the new commands-end-at-semicolons parsing rule, the only way to get an empty query into a script is to explicitly write an extra ";". So we may as well allow the case.

<li>Make initdb's suggested "pg_ctl start" command line more reliable. The original coding here was not nearly careful enough about quoting special characters, and it didn't get corner cases right for constructing the pg_ctl path either. Use join_path_components() and appendShellString() to do it honestly, so that the string will more likely work if blindly copied-and-pasted. While at it, teach appendShellString() not to quote strings that clearly don't need it, so that the output from initdb doesn't become uglier than it was before in typical cases where quoting is not needed.

<li>Once again allow LWLocks to be used within DSM segments. Prior to commit 7882c3b0b95640e361f1533fe0f2d02e4e5d8610, it was possible to use LWLocks within DSM segments, but that commit broke this use case by switching from a doubly linked list to a circular linked list. Switch back, using a new bit of general infrastructure for maintaining lists of PGPROCs.

<li>Fix possible crash due to incorrect allocation context. Commit af33039317ddc4a0e38a02e2255c2bf453115fd2 aimed to reduce leakage from tqueue.c, which is good. Unfortunately, by changing the memory context in which all of gather_readnext() executes, it also changed the context in which ExecShutdownGatherWorkers executes, which is not good, because that function eventually causes a call to ExecParallelRetrieveInstrumentation, which proceeds to allocate planstate-&gt;worker_instrument in a short-lived context, causing a crash.

<li>Improve formatting of comments in plpgsql.h. This file had some unusual comment layout. Most of the comments introducing structs ended up to the right of the screen and following the start of the struct. Some comments for struct members ended up after the member definition. Fix that by moving comments consistently before what they are describing. Also add missing struct tags where missing so that it is easier to tell what the struct is. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9f31e45a6d36a2564423a20601d5066939ea83c1">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9f31e45a6d36a2564423a20601d5066939ea83c1</a></li>

<li>doc: Speed up XSLT builds. The upstream XSLT stylesheets use some very general XPath expressions in some places that end up being very slow. We can optimize them with knowledge about the DocBook document structure and our particular use thereof. For example, when counting preceding chapters to get a number for the current chapter, we only need to count preceding sibling nodes (more or less) instead of searching through the entire node tree for chapter elements. This change attacks the slowest pieces as identified by xsltproc --profile. This makes the HTML build roughly 10 times faster, resulting in the new total build time being about the same as the old DSSSL-based build. Some of the non-HTML build targets (especially FO) will also benefit a bit, but they have not been specifically analyzed. With this, also remove the pg.fast parameter, which was previously a hack to get the build to a manageable speed.

<li>Disable update_process_title by default on Windows. The performance overhead of this can be significant on Windows, and most people don't have the tools to view it anyway as Windows does not have native support for process titles.

<li>Properly re-initialize replication slot shared memory upon creation. Slot creation did not clear all fields upon creation. After start the memory is zeroed, but when a physical replication slot was created in the shared memory of a previously existing logical slot, catalog_xmin would not be cleared. That in turn would prevent vacuum from doing its duties. To fix initialize all the fields. To make similar future bugs less likely, zero all of ReplicationSlotPersistentData, and re-order the rest of the initialization to be in struct member order. Analysis: Andrew Gierth. Reported-By: md@chewy.com. Author: Michael Paquier. Discussion: &lt;20160705173502.1398.70934@wrigleys.postgresql.org&gt;. Backpatch: 9.4, where replication slots were introduced <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2d7e591007a6f44e5e27e2b6c1098483105c0d10">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2d7e591007a6f44e5e27e2b6c1098483105c0d10</a></li>

<li>Fix deletion of speculatively inserted TOAST on conflict. INSERT .. ON CONFLICT runs a pre-check of the possible conflicting constraints before performing the actual speculative insertion. In case the inserted tuple included TOASTed columns the ON CONFLICT condition would be handled correctly in case the conflict was caught by the pre-check, but if two transactions entered the speculative insertion phase at the same time, one would have to re-try, and the code for aborting a speculative insertion did not handle deleting the speculatively inserted TOAST datums correctly. TOAST deletion would fail with "ERROR: attempted to delete invisible tuple" as we attempted to remove the TOAST tuples using simple_heap_delete which reasoned that the given tuples should not be visible to the command that wrote them. This commit updates the heap_abort_speculative() function which aborts the conflicting tuple to use itself, via toast_delete, for deleting associated TOAST datums. Like before, the inserted toast rows are not marked as being speculative. This commit also adds a isolationtester spec test, exercising the relevant code path. Unfortunately 9.5 cannot handle two waiting sessions, and thus cannot execute this test. Reported-By: Viren Negi, Oskari Saarenmaa. Author: Oskari Saarenmaa, edited a bit by me. Bug: #14150.

<li>Refactor sendAuthRequest. This way sendAuthRequest doesn't need to know the details of all the different authentication methods.

<li>Refactor RandomSalt to handle salts of different lengths. All we need is 4 bytes at the moment, for MD5 authentication. But in upcomint patches for SCRAM authentication, SCRAM will need a salt of different length.

<li>reorderbuffer: preserve errno while reporting error. Clobbering errno during cleanup after an error is an oft-repeated, easy to make mistake. Deal with it here as everywhere else, by saving it aside and restoring after cleanup, before ereport'ing.
