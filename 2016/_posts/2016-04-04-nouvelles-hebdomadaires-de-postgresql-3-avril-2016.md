<h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>

<p>Andres Freund pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>pg_rewind: Close backup_label file descriptor. This was a relatively harmless leak, as createBackupLabel() is only called once per pg_rewind invocation. Author: Michael Paquier Reported-By: Michael Paquier Discussion: CAB7nPqRnOw30gOXe2_SPLjh37bgm4V+txbYAPwoXb97nGQ297w@mail.gmail.com Backpatch: 9.5, where pg_rewind was introduced <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a6c845946dac5c1f26cf8729cf61f1d852f75484">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a6c845946dac5c1f26cf8729cf61f1d852f75484</a></li>

<li>Fix LWLockReportWaitEnd() parameter list to be (void). Previously it was an "old style" function declaration. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9f7c527af308dcdaba2f0ff9d362d672e8886fb1">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9f7c527af308dcdaba2f0ff9d362d672e8886fb1</a></li>

<li>pg_rewind: fsync target data directory. Previously pg_rewind did not fsync any files. That's problematic, given that the target directory is modified. If the database was started afterwards, 2ce439f33 luckily already caused the data directory to be synced to disk at postmaster startup; reducing the scope of the problem. To fix, use initdb -S, at the end of the pg_rewind run. It doesn't seem worthwhile to duplicate the code into pg_rewind, and initdb -S is already used that way by pg_upgrade.

<ul>

<li>Clamp adjusted ndistinct to positive integer in estimate_hash_bucketsize(). This avoids a possible divide-by-zero in the following calculation, and rounding the number to an integer seems like saner behavior anyway. Assuming IEEE math, the division would yield +Infinity which would get replaced by 1.0 at the bottom of the function, so nothing really interesting would ensue; but avoiding divide-by-zero seems like a good idea on general principles. Per report from Piotr Stefaniak. No back-patch since this seems mostly cosmetic. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fa09f8935156533584b4e215bdf70ec1ff968dad">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fa09f8935156533584b4e215bdf70ec1ff968dad</a></li>

<li>Guard against zero vardata.rel-&gt;tuples in estimate_hash_bucketsize(). If the referenced rel was proven empty, we'd compute 0/0 here, which results in the function returning NaN. That's a bit more serious than the other zero-divide case. Still, it only seems to be possible in HEAD, so no back-patch. Per report from Piotr Stefaniak. I looked through the rest of selfuncs.c and found no other likely trouble spots. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d65b665d524a67273b075f468bf3d60ce31f4040">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d65b665d524a67273b075f468bf3d60ce31f4040</a></li>

<li>Release notes for 9.5.2, 9.4.7, 9.3.12, 9.2.16, 9.1.21. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/499a50571c72f41bb1365970d55dae5c8afcb6ba">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/499a50571c72f41bb1365970d55dae5c8afcb6ba</a></li>

<li>Code and docs review for commit 3187d6de0e5a9e805b27c48437897e8c39071d45. Fix up check for high-bit-set characters, which provoked "comparison is always true due to limited range of data type" warnings on some compilers, and was unlike the way we do it elsewhere anyway. Fix omission of "$" from the set of valid identifier continuation characters. Get rid of sanitize_text(), which was utterly inconsistent with any other error report anywhere in the system, and wasn't even well designed on its own terms (double-quoting the result string without escaping contained double quotes doesn't seem very well thought out). Fix up error messages, which didn't follow the message style guidelines very well, and were overly specific in situations where the actual mistake might not be what they said. Improve documentation. (I started out just intending to fix the compiler warning, but the more I looked at the patch the less I liked it.) <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d12e5bb79bb535c2df13b76cd7d01f0bb8dc8e4d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d12e5bb79bb535c2df13b76cd7d01f0bb8dc8e4d</a></li>

<li>Document errhidecontext() where it ought to be documented. Seems to have been missed when this function was added. Noted while looking at David Steele's proposal to add another similar function. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e5a4dea80f2506a7a565508e48aaa52296ff410a">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e5a4dea80f2506a7a565508e48aaa52296ff410a</a></li>

<li>Sync our copy of the timezone library with IANA release tzcode2016c. We hadn't done this in about six years, which proves to have been a mistake because there's been a lot of code churn upstream, making the merge rather painful. But putting it off any further isn't going to lessen the pain, and there are at least two incompatible changes that we need to absorb before someone starts complaining that --with-system-tzdata doesn't work at all on their platform, or we get blindsided by a tzdata release that our out-of-date zic can't compile. Last week's "time zone abbreviation differs from POSIX standard" mess was a wake-up call in that regard. This is a sufficiently large patch that I'm afraid to back-patch it immediately, though the foregoing considerations imply that we probably should do so eventually. For the moment, just put it in HEAD so that it can get some testing. Maybe we can wait till the end of the 9.6 beta cycle before deeming it okay. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1c1a7cbd6a1600c97dfcd9b5dc78a23b5db9bbf6">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1c1a7cbd6a1600c97dfcd9b5dc78a23b5db9bbf6</a></li>

<li>Fix MSVC build for changes in zic. zic now only needs zic.c, but I didn't realize knowledge about it was hardwired into Mkvcbuild.pm. Per buildfarm. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f5f15ea6aad1b75c1c133a914cf29f9831089a6e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f5f15ea6aad1b75c1c133a914cf29f9831089a6e</a></li>

<li>Sync tzload() and tzparse() APIs with IANA release tzcode2016c. This brings us a bit closer to matching upstream, but since it affects files outside src/timezone/, we might choose not to back-patch it. Hence keep it separate from the main update patch. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1f4e9da624a0caf78bcb526f6b05f5993e26f2c7">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1f4e9da624a0caf78bcb526f6b05f5993e26f2c7</a></li>

<li>Fix portability issues in 86c43f4e22c0771fd0cc6bce2799802c894ee2ec. INT64_MIN/MAX should be spelled PG_INT64_MIN/MAX, per well established convention in our sources. Less obviously, a symbol named DOUBLE causes problems on Windows builds, so rename that to DOUBLE_CONST; and rename INTEGER to INTEGER_CONST for consistency. Also, get rid of incorrect/obsolete hand-munging of yycolumn, and fix the grammar for float constants to handle expected cases such as ".1". First two items by Michael Paquier, second two by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/656ee8489053aafc85324b9ef7e91b645674ffb9">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/656ee8489053aafc85324b9ef7e91b645674ffb9</a></li>

<li>Fix zic for Windows. The new coding of dolink() is dependent on link() returning an on-point errno when it fails; but the quick-hack implementation of link() that we'd put in for Windows didn't bother with setting errno. Fix that. Analysis and patch by Christian Ullrich. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6d257e732b358ee601a114fe3d1640a46317e554">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6d257e732b358ee601a114fe3d1640a46317e554</a></li>

<li>Protect zic's symlink() call with #ifdef HAVE_SYMLINK. The IANA crew seem to think that symlink() exists everywhere nowadays, and they may well be right. But we use #ifdef HAVE_SYMLINK elsewhere so for consistency we should do it here too. Noted by Michael Paquier. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/534da37927f97ae7cb1b468963ba9bca747209ea">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/534da37927f97ae7cb1b468963ba9bca747209ea</a></li>

<li>Avoid possibly-unsafe use of Windows' FormatMessage() function. Whenever this function is used with the FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM flag, it's good practice to include FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS as well. Otherwise, if the message contains any %n insertion markers, the function will try to fetch argument strings to substitute --- which we are not passing, possibly leading to a crash. This is exactly analogous to the rule about not giving printf() a format string you're not in control of. Noted and patched by Christian Ullrich. Back-patch to all supported branches. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7abc1571652a924ba4258bda0a26df2de03b790e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7abc1571652a924ba4258bda0a26df2de03b790e</a></li>

<li>Allow to_timestamp(float8) to convert float infinity to timestamp infinity. With the original SQL-function implementation, such cases failed because we don't support infinite intervals. Converting the function to C lets us bypass the interval representation, which should be a bit faster as well as more flexible. Vitaly Burovoy, reviewed by Anastasia Lubennikova <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e511d878f3bbc205cd260a79740e646eea3c1cd3">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e511d878f3bbc205cd260a79740e646eea3c1cd3</a></li>

<li>Fix interval_mul() to not produce insane results. interval_mul() attempts to prevent its calculations from producing silly results, but it forgot that zero times infinity yields NaN in IEEE arithmetic. Hence, a case like '1 second'::interval * 'infinity'::float8 produced a NaN for the months product, which didn't trigger the range check, resulting in bogus and possibly platform-dependent output. This isn't terribly obvious to the naked eye because if you try that exact case, you get "interval out of range" which is what you expect --- but if you look closer, the error is coming from interval_out not interval_mul. interval_mul has allowed a bogus value into the system. Fix by adding isnan tests. Noted while testing Vitaly Burovoy's fix for infinity input to to_timestamp(). Given the lack of field complaints, I doubt this is worth a back-patch. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a898b409f66f956e99694710f537829db02652c0">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a898b409f66f956e99694710f537829db02652c0</a></li>

<li>Remove TZ environment-variable entry from postgres reference page. The server hasn't paid attention to the TZ environment variable since commit ca4af308c32d03db, but that commit missed removing this documentation reference, as did commit d883b916a947a3c6 which added the reference where it now belongs (initdb). Back-patch to 9.2 where the behavior changed. Also back-patch d883b916a947a3c6 as needed. Matthew Somerville <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c3834ef9e8abaca54ae542eac960f96e9fecc9a8">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c3834ef9e8abaca54ae542eac960f96e9fecc9a8</a></li>

<li>Remove just-added tests for to_timestamp(float8) with out-of-range inputs. Reporting the specific out-of-range input value produces platform-dependent results. We could skip reporting the value, but that's contrary to our message style guidelines and unhelpful to users. Or we could add a separate expected-output file for Windows, but that would be a substantial maintenance burden, and these test cases seem unlikely to be worth it. Per buildfarm. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c53ab8a3af46029b72634ec0643e78661b252f62">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c53ab8a3af46029b72634ec0643e78661b252f62</a></li>

<li>Suppress uninitialized-variable warnings. My compiler doesn't like the lack of initialization of "flag", and I think it's right: if there were zero keys we'd have an undefined result. The AND of zero items is TRUE, so initialize to TRUE. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/818e59373625d194bdec89631b661c4355d15f13">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/818e59373625d194bdec89631b661c4355d15f13</a></li>

<li>Improve portability of I/O behavior for the geometric types. Formerly, the geometric I/O routines such as box_in and point_out relied directly on strtod() and sprintf() for conversion of the float8 component values of their data types. However, the behavior of those functions is pretty platform-dependent, especially for edge-case values such as infinities and NaNs. This was exposed by commit acdf2a8b372aec1d, which added test cases involving boxes with infinity endpoints, and immediately failed on Windows and AIX buildfarm members. We solved these problems years ago in the main float8in and float8out functions, so let's fix it by making the geometric types use that code instead of depending directly on the platform-supplied functions. To do this, refactor the float8in code so that it can be used to parse just part of a string, and as a convenience make the guts of float8out usable without going through DirectFunctionCall. While at it, get rid of geo_ops.c's fairly shaky assumptions about the maximum output string length for a double, by having it build results in StringInfo buffers instead of fixed-length strings. In passing, convert all the "invalid input syntax for type foo" messages in this area of the code into "invalid input syntax for type %s" to reduce the number of distinct translatable strings, per recent discussion. We would have needed a fair number of the latter anyway for code-sharing reasons, so we might as well just go whole hog. Note: this patch is by no means intended to guarantee that the geometric types uniformly behave sanely for infinity or NaN component values. But any bugs we have in that line were there all along, they were just harder to reach in a platform-independent way. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/50861cd683e86d5ef2dc1cb669fb503225e4eb98">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/50861cd683e86d5ef2dc1cb669fb503225e4eb98</a></li>

<li>Last-minute updates for release notes. Security: CVE-2016-2193, CVE-2016-3065 <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4c46f83386a7e3556856d1e4c9f0c294d16b0dcc">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4c46f83386a7e3556856d1e4c9f0c294d16b0dcc</a></li>

<li>Support using index-only scans with partial indexes in more cases. Previously, the planner would reject an index-only scan if any restriction clause for its table used a column not available from the index, even if that restriction clause would later be dropped from the plan entirely because it's implied by the index's predicate. This is a fairly common situation for partial indexes because predicates using columns not included in the index are often the most useful kind of predicate, and we have to duplicate (or at least imply) the predicate in the WHERE clause in order to get the index to be considered at all. So index-only scans were essentially unavailable with such partial indexes. To fix, we have to do detection of implied-by-predicate clauses much earlier in the planner. This patch puts it in check_index_predicates (nee check_partial_indexes), meaning it gets done for every partial index, whereas we previously only considered this issue at createplan time, so that the work was only done for an index actually selected for use. That could result in a noticeable planning slowdown for queries against tables with many partial indexes. However, testing suggested that there isn't really a significant cost, especially not with reasonable numbers of partial indexes. We do get a small additional benefit, which is that cost_index is more accurate since it correctly discounts the evaluation cost of clauses that will be removed. We can also avoid considering such clauses as potential indexquals, which saves useless matching cycles in the case where the predicate columns aren't in the index, and prevents generating bogus plans that double-count the clause's selectivity when the columns are in the index. Tomas Vondra and Kyotaro Horiguchi, reviewed by Kevin Grittner and Konstantin Knizhnik, and whacked around a little by me <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f9aefcb91fc1f73fc43e384f660c120e515af931">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f9aefcb91fc1f73fc43e384f660c120e515af931</a></li>

<li>Another zic portability fix. I should have remembered that we can't use INT64_MODIFIER with sscanf(): configure chooses that to work with snprintf(), but it might be for our src/port/snprintf.c implementation and so not compatible with the platform's sscanf(). This appears to be the explanation for buildfarm member frogmouth's continuing unhappiness with the tzcode update. Fortunately, in all of the places where zic is attempting to read into an int64 variable, it's reading a year which certainly will fit just fine into an int. So make it read into an int with %d, and then cast or copy as necessary. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c202ecf9023ac3571709c274b326038ae39e90a7">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c202ecf9023ac3571709c274b326038ae39e90a7</a></li>

<li>Fix oversight in getParamDescriptions(), and improve comments. When getParamDescriptions was changed to handle out-of-memory better by cribbing error recovery logic from getRowDescriptions/getAnotherTuple, somebody omitted to copy the stanza about checking for excess data in the message. But you need to do that, since continue'ing out of the switch in pqParseInput3 means no such check gets applied there anymore. Noted while looking at Michael Paquier's patch that made yet another copy of this advance_and_error logic. (This whole business desperately needs refactoring, because I sure don't want to see a dozen copies of this code, but that's where we seem to be headed. What's more, the "suspend parsing on EOF return" convention is a holdover from protocol 2 and shouldn't exist at all in protocol 3, because we don't process partial messages anymore. But for now, just fix the obvious bug.) Also, fix some wrong/missing comments about what the API spec is for these three functions. This doesn't seem worthy of back-patching, even though it's a bug; the case shouldn't ever arise in the field. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2306696004dc6b9259a45e76522c01d6ee5d2ee7">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2306696004dc6b9259a45e76522c01d6ee5d2ee7</a></li>

<li>Get rid of minus zero in box regression test. Commit acdf2a8b added a test case involving minus zero as a box endpoint. This is not very portable, as evidenced by the several older buildfarm members that are failing on the test because they print minus zero as just "0". If there were any significant reason to test this behavior, we could consider carrying a separate expected-file; but it doesn't look to me like there's adequate justification to accept such a maintenance burden. Just change the test to use plain zero, instead. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a067b50470cf7fda77dd28b03519f2483c2322bf">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a067b50470cf7fda77dd28b03519f2483c2322bf</a></li>

<li>Omit null rows when applying the Haas-Stokes estimator for ndistinct. Previously, we included null rows in the values of n and N that went into the formula, which amounts to considering null as a value in its own right; but the d and f1 values do not include nulls. This is inconsistent, and it contributes to significant underestimation of ndistinct when the column is mostly nulls. In any case stadistinct is defined as the number of distinct non-null values, so we should exclude nulls when doing this computation. This is an aboriginal bug in our application of the Haas-Stokes formula, but we'll refrain from back-patching for fear of destabilizing plan choices in released branches. While at it, make the code a bit more readable by omitting unnecessary casts and intermediate variables. Observation and original patch by Tomas Vondra, adjusted to fix both uses of the formula by Alex Shulgin, cosmetic improvements by me <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/be4b4dc75955318e763f5b2e3a990e35366ac797">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/be4b4dc75955318e763f5b2e3a990e35366ac797</a></li>

<li>Omit null rows when setting the threshold for what's a most-common value. As with the previous patch, large numbers of null rows could skew this calculation unfavorably, causing us to discard values that have a legitimate claim to be MCVs, since our definition of MCV is that it's most common among the non-null population of the column. Hence, make the numerator of avgcount be the number of non-null sample values not the number of sample rows; likewise for maxmincount in the compute_scalar_stats variant. Also, make the denominator be the number of distinct values actually observed in the sample, rather than reversing it back out of the computed stadistinct. This avoids depending on the accuracy of the Haas-Stokes approximation, and really it's what we want anyway; the threshold should depend only on what we see in the sample, not on what we extrapolate about the contents of the whole column. Alex Shulgin, reviewed by Tomas Vondra and myself <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3d3bf62f30200500637b24fdb7b992a99f9704c3">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3d3bf62f30200500637b24fdb7b992a99f9704c3</a></li>

<li>Suppress compiler warning. Some buildfarm members are showing "comparison is always false due to limited range of data type" complaints on this test, so #ifdef it out on machines with 32-bit int. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/45aae8e78967b37f285e99617b919319bf2bf536">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/45aae8e78967b37f285e99617b919319bf2bf536</a></li>

<li>Add missing "static". Per buildfarm member pademelon. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5a5b917184b630529635db2e037d298ad90c355d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5a5b917184b630529635db2e037d298ad90c355d</a></li>

<li>Make all the declarations of WaitEventSetWaitBlock be marked "inline". The inconsistency here triggered compiler warnings on some buildfarm members, and it's surely pretty pointless. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a1953f3a60cc7d1b8516d0b2c7e82ae8e9242de3">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a1953f3a60cc7d1b8516d0b2c7e82ae8e9242de3</a></li>

<li>Add psql \errverbose command to see last server error at full verbosity. Often, upon getting an unexpected error in psql, one's first wish is that the verbosity setting had been higher; for example, to be able to see the schema-name field or the server code location info. Up to now the only way has been to adjust the VERBOSITY variable and repeat the failing query. That's a pain, and it doesn't work if the error isn't reproducible. This commit adds a psql feature that redisplays the most recent server error at full verbosity, without needing to make any variable changes or re-execute the failed command. We just need to hang onto the latest error PGresult in case the user executes \errverbose, and then apply libpq's new PQresultVerboseErrorMessage() function to it. This will consume some trivial amount of psql memory, but otherwise the cost when the feature isn't used should be negligible. Alex Shulgin, reviewed by Daniel V&Atilde;&copy;rit&Atilde;&copy;, some improvements by me <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3cc38ca7d21255721d600eb75d7cc6708c14764b">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3cc38ca7d21255721d600eb75d7cc6708c14764b</a></li>

<li>Add libpq support for recreating an error message with different verbosity. Often, upon getting an unexpected error in psql, one's first wish is that the verbosity setting had been higher; for example, to be able to see the schema-name field or the server code location info. Up to now the only way has been to adjust the VERBOSITY variable and repeat the failing query. That's a pain, and it doesn't work if the error isn't reproducible. This commit adds support in libpq for regenerating the error message for an existing error PGresult at any desired verbosity level. This is almost just a matter of refactoring the existing code into a subroutine, but there is one bit of possibly-needed information that was not getting put into PGresults: the text of the last query sent to the server. We must add that string to the contents of an error PGresult. But we only need to save it if it might be used, which with the existing error-formatting code only happens if there is a PG_DIAG_STATEMENT_POSITION error field, which is probably pretty rare for errors in production situations. So really the overhead when the feature isn't used should be negligible. Alex Shulgin, reviewed by Daniel V&Atilde;&copy;rit&Atilde;&copy;, some improvements by me <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e3161b231cfaadd4b6438eff2fc1f6cd086f41a9">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e3161b231cfaadd4b6438eff2fc1f6cd086f41a9</a></li>

<li>Clean up some stuff in new contrib/bloom module. Coverity complained about implicit sign-extension in the BloomPageGetFreeSpace macro, probably because sizeOfBloomTuple isn't wide enough for size calculations. No overflow is really possible as long as maxoff and sizeOfBloomTuple are small enough to represent a realistic situation, but it seems like a good idea to declare sizeOfBloomTuple as Size not int32. Add missing check on BloomPageAddItem() result, again from Coverity. Avoid core dump due to not allocating so-&gt;sign array when scan-&gt;numberOfKeys is zero. Also thanks to Coverity. Use FLEXIBLE_ARRAY_MEMBER rather than declaring an array as size 1 when it isn't necessarily. Very minor beautification of related code. Unfortunately, none of the Coverity-detected mistakes look like they could account for the remaining buildfarm unhappiness with this module. It's barely possible that the FLEXIBLE_ARRAY_MEMBER mistake does account for that, if it's enabling bogus compiler optimizations; but I'm not terribly optimistic. We probably still have bugs to find here. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a9284849b48b04fa2836aaf704659974c13e610d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a9284849b48b04fa2836aaf704659974c13e610d</a></li>

<li>Fix support of digits in email/hostnames. When tsearch was implemented I did several mistakes in hostname/email definition rules: 1) allow underscore in hostname what prohibited by RFC 2) forget to allow leading digits separated by hyphen (like 123-x.com) in hostname 3) do no allow underscore/hyphen after leading digits in localpart of email Artur's patch resolves two last issues, but by the way allows hosts name like 123_x.com together with 123-x.com. RFC forbids underscore usage in hostname but pg allows that since initial tsearch version in core, although only for non-digits. Patch syncs support digits and nondigits in both hostname and email. Forbidding underscore in hostname may break existsing usage of tsearch and, anyhow, it should be done by separate patch.

<li>Introduce traversalValue for SP-GiST scan During scan sometimes it would be very helpful to know some information about parent node or all ancestor nodes.

<li>Enable logical slots to follow timeline switches. When decoding from a logical slot, it's necessary for xlog reading to be able to read xlog from historical (i.e. not current) timelines; otherwise, decoding fails after failover, because the archives are in the historical timeline. This is required to make "failover logical slots" possible; it currently has no other use, although theoretically it could be used by an extension that creates a slot on a standby and continues to replay from the slot when the standby is promoted. This commit includes a module in src/test/modules with functions to manipulate the slots (which is not otherwise possible in SQL code) in order to enable testing, and a new test in src/test/recovery to ensure that the behavior is as expected.

<li>Type names should not be quoted. Our actual convention, contrary to what I said in 59a2111b23f, is not to quote type names, as evidenced by unquoted use of format_type_be() result value in error messages. Remove quotes from recently tweaked messages accordingly. Per note from Tom Lane <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f402b9950120358d1870aacc10070e121d8a17de">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f402b9950120358d1870aacc10070e121d8a17de</a></li>

<li>Improve internationalization of messages involving type names. Change the slightly different variations of the message function FOO must return type BAR to a single wording, removing the variability in type name so that they all create a single translation entry; since the type name is not to be translated, there's no point in it being part of the message anyway. Also, change them all to use the same quoting convention, namely that the function name is not to be quoted but the type name is. (I'm not quite sure why this is so, but it's the clear majority.) Some similar messages such as "encoding conversion function FOO must ..." are also changed. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/59a2111b23f6ceec4c777d68e20c1027d3c57c6f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/59a2111b23f6ceec4c777d68e20c1027d3c57c6f</a></li>

<li>Fix logical_decoding_timelines test crashes. In the test_slot_timelines test module, we were abusing passing NULL values which was received as zeroes in x86, but this breaks in ARM (buildfarm member hamster) by crashing instead. Fix the breakage by marking these functions as STRICT; the InvalidXid value that was previously implicit in NULL values (on x86 at least) can now be passed as 0. Failing to follow the fmgr protocol to check for NULLs beforehand was causing ARM to fail, as evidenced by segmentation faults in buildfarm member hamster. In order to use the new functionality in the test script, use COALESCE in the right spot to avoid forwarding NULL values. This was diagnosed from the hamster crash by Craig Ringer, who also proposed a different patch (checking for NULL values explicitely in the C function code, and keeping the non-strictness in the C functions). I decided to go with this approach instead. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/82c83b337202fa0f5b235bdfaeb992a5cee40ed5">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/82c83b337202fa0f5b235bdfaeb992a5cee40ed5</a></li>

This is not backward-compatible, but we generally don't promise that for C APIs, and there probably aren't many people using this yet anyway. KaiGai Kohei, reviewed by Petr Jelinek and me. Some further cosmetic changes by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f9143d102ffd0947ca904c62b1d3d6fd587e0c80">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f9143d102ffd0947ca904c62b1d3d6fd587e0c80</a></li>

<li>pgbench: Remove \setrandom. You can now do the same thing via \set using the appropriate function, either random(), random_gaussian(), or random_exponential(), depending on the desired distribution. This is not backward-compatible, but per discussion, it's worth it to avoid having the old syntax hang around forever. Fabien Coelho, reviewed by Michael Paquier, and adjusted by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ad9566470b1ba63167d1dc7ae2cb52d88a448f76">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ad9566470b1ba63167d1dc7ae2cb52d88a448f76</a></li>

<li>Fix pgbench documentation error. The description of what the per-transaction log file says for skipped transactions is just plain wrong. Report and patch by Tomas Vondra, reviewed by Fabien Coelho and modified by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d797bf7da2cc954f7b5cd2776b65c6e91cd0cb04">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d797bf7da2cc954f7b5cd2776b65c6e91cd0cb04</a></li>

<li>Improve pgbench docs regarding per-transaction logging. The old documentation didn't know about the new -b flag, only about -f.

<li>Allow aggregate transition states to be serialized and deserialized. This is necessary infrastructure for supporting parallel aggregation for aggregates whose transition type is "internal". Such values can't be passed between cooperating processes, because they are just pointers. David Rowley, reviewed by Tomas Vondra and by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5fe5a2cee91117673e04617aeb1a38e305dcd783">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5fe5a2cee91117673e04617aeb1a38e305dcd783</a></li>

<li>Fix bug in aggregate (de)serialization commit. resulttypeLen and resulttypeByVal must be set correctly when serializing aggregates, not just when finalizing them. This was in David's final patch but I downloaded the wrong version by mistake and failed to spot the error. David Rowley <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/96f8373cad5d6066baeb7a1c5a88f6f5c9661974">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/96f8373cad5d6066baeb7a1c5a88f6f5c9661974</a></li>

<li>Add new replication mode synchronous_commit = 'remote_apply'. In this mode, the master waits for the transaction to be applied on the remote side, not just written to disk. That means that you can count on a transaction started on the standby to see all commits previously acknowledged by the master. To make this work, the standby sends a reply after replaying each commit record generated with synchronous_commit &gt;= 'remote_apply'. This introduces a small inefficiency: the extra replies will be sent even by standbys that aren't the current synchronous standby. But previously-existing synchronous_commit levels make no attempt at all to optimize which replies are sent based on what the primary cares about, so this is no worse, and at least avoids any extra replies for people not using the feature at all. Thomas Munro, reviewed by Michael Paquier and by me. Some additional tweaks by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/314cbfc5da988eff8998655158f84c9815ecfbcd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/314cbfc5da988eff8998655158f84c9815ecfbcd</a></li>

<li>Reset plan-&gt;row_security_env and planUserId. In the plancache, we check if the environment we planned the query under has changed in a way which requires us to re-plan, such as when the user for whom the plan was prepared changes and RLS is being used (and, therefore, there may be different policies to apply). Unfortunately, while those values were set and checked, they were not being reset when the query was re-planned and therefore, in cases where we change role, re-plan, and then change role again, we weren't re-planning again. This leads to potentially incorrect policies being applied in cases where role-specific policies are used and a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles, which could happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs. Further, extensions which made use of CopyCachedPlan() may suffer from similar issues as the RLS-related fields were not properly copied as part of the plan and therefore RevalidateCachedQuery() would copy in the current settings without invalidating the query. Fix by using the same approach used for 'search_path', where we set the correct values in CompleteCachedPlan(), check them early on in RevalidateCachedQuery() and then properly reset them if re-planning. Also, copy through the values during CopyCachedPlan(). Pointed out by Ashutosh Bapat. Reviewed by Michael Paquier. Back-patch to 9.5 where RLS was introduced.

<li>Avoid pin scan for replay of XLOG_BTREE_VACUUM in all cases. Replay of XLOG_BTREE_VACUUM during Hot Standby was previously thought to require complex interlocking that matched the requirements on the master. This required an O(N) operation that became a significant problem with large indexes, causing replication delays of seconds or in some cases minutes while the XLOG_BTREE_VACUUM was replayed. This commit skips the pin scan that was previously required, by observing in detail when and how it is safe to do so, with full documentation. The pin scan is skipped only in replay; the VACUUM code path on master is not touched here and WAL is identical. The current commit applies in all cases, effectively replacing commit 687f2cd7a0150647794efe432ae0397cb41b60ff. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3e4b7d87988f0835f137f15f5c1a40598dd21f3d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3e4b7d87988f0835f137f15f5c1a40598dd21f3d</a></li>
