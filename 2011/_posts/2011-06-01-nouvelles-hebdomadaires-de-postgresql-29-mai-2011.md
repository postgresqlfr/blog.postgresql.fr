<p><strong>Revues de code</strong></p>

<p><strong>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</strong></p>

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Install defenses against overflow in BuildTupleHashTable(). The planner can sometimes compute very large values for numGroups, and in cases where we have no alternative to building a hashtable, such a value will get fed directly to BuildTupleHashTable as its nbuckets parameter. There were two ways in which that could go bad. First, BuildTupleHashTable declared the parameter as "int" but most callers were passing "long"s, so on 64-bit machines undetected overflow could occur leading to a bogus negative value. The obvious fix for that is to change the parameter to "long", which is what I've done in HEAD. In the back branches that seems a bit risky, though, since third-party code might be calling this function. So for them, just put in a kluge to treat negative inputs as INT_MAX. Second, hash_create can go nuts with extremely large requested table sizes (notably, my_log2 becomes an infinite loop for inputs larger than LONG_MAX/2). What seems most appropriate to avoid that is to bound the initial table size request to work_mem. This fixes bug #6035 reported by Daniel Schreiber. Although the reported case only occurs back to 8.4 since it involves WITH RECURSIVE, I think it's a good idea to install the defenses in all supported branches.

<li>Lobotomize typmod check in convert_tuples_by_position, back branches only. convert_tuples_by_position was rejecting attempts to coerce a record field with -1 typmod to the same type with a non-default typmod. This is in fact the "correct" thing to do (since we're just going to do a type relabeling, not invoke any length-conversion cast function); but it results in rejecting valid cases like bug #6020, because the source record's tupdesc is built from Params that don't have typmod assigned. Since that's a regression from previous versions, which accepted this code, we have to do something about it. In HEAD, I've fixed the problem properly by causing the Params to receive the correct typmods; but the potential for incidental behavioral changes seems high enough to make it unattractive to make the same change in released branches. (And it couldn't be fixed that way in 8.4 anyway...) Hence this patch just modifies convert_tuples_by_position to not complain if either the input or the output tupdesc has typmod -1. This is still a shade tighter checking than we did before 9.0, since before that plpgsql failed to consider typmods at all when checking record compatibility. (convert_tuples_by_position is currently used only by plpgsql, so we're not affecting other behavior.) Back-patch to 8.4, since we recently back-ported convert_tuples_by_position into that branch. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e48433e9f81d6aceef2b538f1783fbcc91e1074f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e48433e9f81d6aceef2b538f1783fbcc91e1074f</a></li>

<li>Make plpgsql complain about conflicting IN and OUT parameter names. The core CREATE FUNCTION code only enforces that IN parameter names are non-duplicate, and that OUT parameter names are separately non-duplicate. This is because some function languages might not have any confusion between the two. But in plpgsql, such names are all in the same namespace, so we'd better disallow it. Per a recent complaint from Dan S. Not back-patching since this is a small issue and the change could cause unexpected failures if we started to enforce it in a minor release.

<li>Avoid uninitialized bits in the result of QTN2QT(). Found with additional valgrind testing. Noah Misch

<li>Adjust configure's probe for libselinux so it rejects too-old versions. We need at least version 2.0.93, so probe for a function that was added in that version. Kaigai Kohei 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8ff1f6a78c4fb48337f671f1586839cef5d4b940">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8ff1f6a78c4fb48337f671f1586839cef5d4b940</a></li>

<li>Cleanup for pull-up-isReset patch. Clear isReset before, not after, calling the context-specific alloc method, so as to preserve the option to do a tail call in MemoryContextAlloc (and also so this code isn't assuming that a failed alloc call won't have changed the context's state before failing). Fix missed direct invocation of reset method. Reformat a comment.

<li>Grammar cleanup for src/test/isolation/README. Josh Kupershmidt 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/446d5d32aedcca378578c8fe1c2eed34df92a238">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/446d5d32aedcca378578c8fe1c2eed34df92a238</a></li>

<li>Suppress extensions in partial dumps. We initially had pg_dump emit CREATE EXTENSION commands unconditionally. However, pg_dump has long been in the habit of not dumping procedural language definitions when a --schema or --table switch is given. It seems appropriate to handle extensions the same way, since like PLs they are SQL objects that are not in any particular schema. Per complaint from Adrian Schreyer. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7b158d1baed859971c1aa792bff6a7e1f721cf91">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7b158d1baed859971c1aa792bff6a7e1f721cf91</a></li>

<li>Adjust configure to use "+Olibmerrno" with HP-UX C compiler, if possible. This is reported to be necessary on some versions of that OS. In service of this, cause PGAC_PROG_CC_CFLAGS_OPT to reject switches that result in compiler warnings, since on yet other versions of that OS, the switch does nothing except provoke a warning. Report and patch by Ibrar Ahmed, further tweaking by me. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/44404f394517f89a0bebb1aaace6e64ad79d2817">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/44404f394517f89a0bebb1aaace6e64ad79d2817</a></li>

<li>Make decompilation of optimized CASE constructs more robust. We had some hacks in ruleutils.c to cope with various odd transformations that the optimizer could do on a CASE foo WHEN "CaseTestExpr = RHS" clause. However, the fundamental impossibility of covering all cases was exposed by Heikki, who pointed out that the "=" operator could get replaced by an inlined SQL function, which could contain nearly anything at all. So give up on the hacks and just print the expression as-is if we fail to recognize it as "CaseTestExpr = RHS". (We must cover that case so that decompiled rules print correctly; but we are not under any obligation to make EXPLAIN output be 100% valid SQL in all cases, and already could not do so in some other cases.) This approach requires that we have some printable representation of the CaseTestExpr node type; I used "CASE_TEST_EXPR". Back-patch to all supported branches, since the problem case fails in all. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3987e9e62046bd800d8d08566ed49fee1ae6cb86">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3987e9e62046bd800d8d08566ed49fee1ae6cb86</a></li>

<li>Preserve caller's memory context in ProcessCompletedNotifies(). This is necessary to avoid long-term memory leakage, because the main loop in PostgresMain expects to be executing in MessageContext, and hence is a bit sloppy about freeing stuff that is only needed for the duration of processing the current client message. The known case of an actual leak is when encoding conversion has to be done on the incoming command string, but there might be others. Per report from Per-Olov Esgard. Back-patch to 9.0, where the bug was introduced by the LISTEN/NOTIFY rewrite. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/90857b48e1f69dbca52f498bd444190d36dbd73f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/90857b48e1f69dbca52f498bd444190d36dbd73f</a></li>

<li>Improve corner cases in pg_ctl's new wait-for-postmaster-startup code. With "-w -t 0", we should report "still starting up", not "ok". If we fall out of the loop without ever being able to call PQping (because we were never able to construct a connection string), report "no response", not "ok". This gets rid of corner cases in which we'd claim the server had started even though it had not. Also, if the postmaster.pid file is not there at any point after we've waited 5 seconds, assume the postmaster has failed and report that, rather than almost-certainly-fruitlessly continuing to wait. The pidfile should appear almost instantly even when there is extensive startup work to do, so 5 seconds is already a very conservative figure. This part is per a gripe from MauMau --- there might be better ways to do it, but nothing simple enough to get done for 9.1.

<li>Fix null-dereference crash in parse_xml_decl(). parse_xml_decl's header comment says you can pass NULL for any unwanted output parameter, but it failed to honor this contract for the "standalone" flag. The only currently-affected caller is xml_recv, so the net effect is that sending a binary XML value containing a standalone parameter in its xml declaration would crash the backend. Per bug #6044 from Christopher Dillard. In passing, remove useless initializations of parse_xml_decl's output parameters in xml_parse. Back-patch to 8.3, where this code was introduced.

<li>Check the return code of pthread_create(). Otherwise we go into an infinite loop if it fails, which is what what happened on my HP-UX box. (I think the reason it failed on that box is a misconfiguration on my behalf, but that's no reason to hang.)
