<ul>

<li>Distinguish XLOG_FPI records generated for hint-bit updates. Add a new XLOG_FPI_FOR_HINT record type, and use that for full-page images generated for hint bit updates, when checksums are enabled. The new record type is replayed exactly the same as XLOG_FPI, but allows them to be tallied separately e.g. in pg_xlogdump.

<li>Add a few paragraphs to B-tree README explaining L&amp;Y algorithm. This gives an overview of what Lehman &amp; Yao's paper is all about, so that you can understand the rest of the README without having to read the paper. Per discussion with Peter Geoghegan and others.

<li>Make Port-&gt;ssl_in_use available, even when built with !USE_SSL. Code that check the flag no longer need #ifdef's, which is more convenient. In particular, makes it easier to write extensions that depend on it. In the passing, modify sslinfo's ssl_is_used function to check ssl_in_use instead of the OpenSSL specific 'ssl' pointer. It doesn't make any difference currently, as sslinfo is only compiled when built with OpenSSL, but seems cleaner anyway.

<li>Check return value of strdup() in libpq connection option parsing. An out-of-memory in most of these would lead to strange behavior, like connecting to a different database than intended, but some would lead to an outright segfault. Alex Shulgin and me. Backpatch to all supported versions.

<li>Allow "dbname" from connection string to be overridden in PQconnectDBParams If the "dbname" attribute in PQconnectDBParams contained a connection string or URI (and expand_dbname = TRUE), the database name from the connection string could not be overridden by a subsequent "dbname" keyword in the array. That was not intentional; all other options can be overridden. Furthermore, any subsequent "dbname" caused the connection string from the first dbname value to be processed again, overriding any values for the same options that were given between the connection string and the second dbname option. In the passing, clarify in the docs that only the first dbname option in the array is parsed as a connection string. Alex Shulgin. Backpatch to all supported versions.

<li>Allow using connection URI in primary_conninfo. The old method of appending options to the connection string didn't work if the primary_conninfo was a postgres:// style URI, instead of a traditional connection string. Use PQconnectdbParams instead. Alex Shulgin

<li>Remove dead function prototype. It was added in commit efc16ea5, but never defined.

<li>Fix assertion failure at end of PITR. InitXLogInsert() cannot be called in a critical section, because it allocates memory. But CreateCheckPoint() did that, when called for the end-of-recovery checkpoint by the startup process. In the passing, fix the scratch space allocation in InitXLogInsert to go to the right memory context. Also update the comment at InitXLOGAccess, which hasn't been totally accurate since hot standby was introduced (in a hot standby backend, InitXLOGAccess isn't called at backend startup). Reported by Michael Paquier

<ul>

<li>Allow simplification of EXISTS() subqueries containing LIMIT. The locution "EXISTS(SELECT ... LIMIT 1)" seems to be rather common among people who don't realize that the database already performs optimizations equivalent to putting LIMIT 1 in the sub-select. Unfortunately, this was actually making things worse, because it prevented us from optimizing such EXISTS clauses into semi or anti joins. Teach simplify_EXISTS_query() to suppress constant-positive LIMIT clauses. That fixes the semi/anti-join case, and may help marginally even for cases that have to be left as sub-SELECTs. Marti Raudsepp, reviewed by David Rowley

<li>Support arrays as input to array_agg() and ARRAY(SELECT ...). These cases formerly failed with errors about "could not find array type for data type". Now they yield arrays of the same element type and one higher dimension. The implementation involves creating functions with API similar to the existing accumArrayResult() family. I (tgl) also extended the base family by adding an initArrayResult() function, which allows callers to avoid special-casing the zero-inputs case if they just want an empty array as result. (Not all do, so the previous calling convention remains valid.) This allowed simplifying some existing code in xml.c and plperl.c. Ali Akbar, reviewed by Pavel Stehule, significantly modified by me 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bac27394a1c69c20ec904729c593e59485c75c69">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bac27394a1c69c20ec904729c593e59485c75c69</a></li>

<li>De-reserve most statement-introducing keywords in plpgsql. Add a bit of context sensitivity to plpgsql_yylex() so that it can recognize when the word it is looking at is the first word of a new statement, and if so whether it is the target of an assignment statement. When we are at start of statement and it's not an assignment, we can prefer recognizing unreserved keywords over recognizing variable names, thereby allowing most statements' initial keywords to be demoted from reserved to unreserved status. This is rather useful already (there are 15 such words that get demoted here), and what's more to the point is that future patches proposing to add new plpgsql statements can avoid objections about having to add new reserved words. The keywords BEGIN, DECLARE, FOR, FOREACH, LOOP, WHILE need to remain reserved because they can be preceded by block labels, and the logic added here doesn't understand about block labels. In principle we could probably fix that, but it would take more than one token of lookback and the benefit doesn't seem worth extra complexity. Also note I didn't de-reserve EXECUTE, because it is used in more places than just statement start. It's possible it could be de-reserved with more work, but that would be an independent fix. In passing, also de-reserve COLLATE and DEFAULT, which shouldn't have been reserved in the first place since they only need to be recognized within DECLARE sections.

<li>Fix uninitialized-variable warning. In passing, add an Assert defending the presumption that bytes_left is positive to start with. (I'm not exactly convinced that using an unsigned type was such a bright thing here, but let's at least do this much.) 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d934a052348c1fa017ff677d08e74c643e3f416c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d934a052348c1fa017ff677d08e74c643e3f416c</a></li>

<li>Free libxml2/libxslt resources in a safer order. Mark Simonetti reported that libxslt sometimes crashes for him, and that swapping xslt_process's object-freeing calls around to do them in reverse order of creation seemed to fix it. I've not reproduced the crash, but valgrind clearly shows a reference to already-freed memory, which is consistent with the idea that shutdown of the xsltTransformContext is trying to reference the already-freed stylesheet or input document. With this patch, valgrind is no longer unhappy. I have an inquiry in to see if this is a libxslt bug or if we're just abusing the library; but even if it's a library bug, we'd want to adjust our code so it doesn't fail with unpatched libraries. Back-patch to all supported branches, because we've been doing this in the wrong(?) order for a long time. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c168ba311228c523923f7ef7699cba96deedcc6d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c168ba311228c523923f7ef7699cba96deedcc6d</a></li>

<li>Improve typcache: cache negative lookup results, add invalidation logic. Previously, if the typcache had for example tried and failed to find a hash opclass for a given data type, it would nonetheless repeat the unsuccessful catalog lookup each time it was asked again. This can lead to a significant amount of useless bufmgr traffic, as in a recent report from Scott Marlowe. Like the catalog caches, typcache should be able to cache negative results. This patch arranges that by making use of separate flag bits to remember whether a particular item has been looked up, rather than treating a zero OID as an indicator that no lookup has been done. Also, install a credible invalidation mechanism, namely watching for inval events in pg_opclass. The sole advantage of the lack of negative caching was that the code would cope if operators or opclasses got added for a type mid-session; to preserve that behavior we have to be able to invalidate stale lookup results. Updates in pg_opclass should be pretty rare in production systems, so it seems sufficient to just invalidate all the dependent data whenever one happens. Adding proper invalidation also means that this code will now react sanely if an opclass is dropped mid-session. Arguably, that's a back-patchable bug fix, but in view of the lack of complaints from the field I'll refrain from back-patching. (Probably, in most cases where an opclass is dropped, the data type itself is dropped soon after, so that this misfeasance has no bad consequences.)

<li>Improve performance of OverrideSearchPathMatchesCurrent(). This function was initially coded on the assumption that it would not be performance-critical, but that turns out to be wrong in workloads that are heavily dependent on the speed of plpgsql functions. Speed it up by hard-coding the comparison rules, thereby avoiding palloc/pfree traffic from creating and immediately freeing an OverrideSearchPath object. Per report from Scott Marlowe.

<li>Add bms_next_member(), and use it where appropriate. This patch adds a way of iterating through the members of a bitmapset nondestructively, unlike the old way with bms_first_member(). While bms_next_member() is very slightly slower than bms_first_member() (at least for typical-size bitmapsets), eliminating the need to palloc and pfree a temporary copy of the target bitmapset is a significant win. So this method should be preferred in all cases where a temporary copy would be necessary. Tom Lane, with suggestions from Dean Rasheed and David Rowley

<li>Add bms_get_singleton_member(), and use it where appropriate. This patch adds a function that replaces a bms_membership() test followed by a bms_singleton_member() call, performing both the test and the extraction of a singleton set's member in one scan of the bitmapset. The performance advantage over the old way is probably minimal in current usage, but it seems worthwhile on notational grounds anyway. David Rowley

<li>Fix minor bugs in commit 30bf4689a96cd283af33edcdd6b7210df3f20cd8 et al. Coverity complained that the "else" added to fillPGconn() was unreachable, which it was. Remove the dead code. In passing, rearrange the tests so as not to bother trying to fetch values for options that can't be assigned. Pre-9.3 did not have that issue, but it did have a "return" that should be "goto oom_error" to ensure that a suitable error message gets filled in.

<li>Suppress DROP CASCADE notices in regression tests. In the regression tests, when doing cascaded drops, we need to suppress the notices from DROP CASCADE or there can be transient regression failures as the order of drops can depend on the physical row order in pg_depend.

<li>Add int64 -&gt; int8 mapping to genbki. Per discussion with Tom and Andrew, 64bit integers are no longer a problem for the catalogs, so go ahead and add the mapping from the C int64 type to the int8 SQL identification to allow using them. Patch by Adam Brightwell

<li>Rename pg_rowsecurity -&gt; pg_policy and other fixes As pointed out by Robert, we should really have named pg_rowsecurity pg_policy, as the objects stored in that catalog are policies. This patch fixes that and updates the column names to start with 'pol' to match the new catalog name. The security consideration for COPY with row level security, also pointed out by Robert, has also been addressed by remembering and re-checking the OID of the relation initially referenced during COPY processing, to make sure it hasn't changed under us by the time we finish planning out the query which has been built. Robert and Alvaro also commented on missing OCLASS and OBJECT entries for POLICY (formerly ROWSECURITY or POLICY, depending) in various places. This patch fixes that too, which also happens to add the ability to COMMENT on policies. In passing, attempt to improve the consistency of messages, comments, and documentation as well. This removes various incarnations of 'row-security', 'row-level security', 'Row-security', etc, in favor of 'policy', 'row level security' or 'row_security' as appropriate. Happy Thanksgiving!
