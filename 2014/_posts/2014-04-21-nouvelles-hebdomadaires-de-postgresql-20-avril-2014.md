<p><strong>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</strong></p>

<p>Heikki Linnakangas a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>GIN entry pages follow the standard page layout - tell XLogInsert. The entry B-tree pages all follow the standard page layout. The 9.3 code has this right. I inadvertently changed this at some point during the big refactorings in git master. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1bd3842163f2b44e29938b5ab158bb6a589ff10c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1bd3842163f2b44e29938b5ab158bb6a589ff10c</a></li>

<li>Remove dead checks for invalid left page in ginDeletePage. In some places, the function assumes the left page is valid, and in others, it checks if it is valid. Remove all the checks. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e3e6e3af560116adc20cc9d6e75bfe82a45def60">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e3e6e3af560116adc20cc9d6e75bfe82a45def60</a></li>

<li>Set pd_lower on internal GIN posting tree pages. This allows squeezing out the unused space in full-page writes. And more importantly, it can be a useful debugging aid. In hindsight we should've done this back when GIN was added - we wouldn't need the 'maxoff' field in the page opaque struct if we had used pd_lower and pd_upper like on normal pages. But as long as there can be pages in the index that have been binary-upgraded from pre-9.4 versions, we can't rely on that, and have to continue using 'maxoff'. Most of the code churn comes from renaming some macros, now that they're used on internal pages, too. This change is completely backwards-compatible, no effect on pg_upgrade. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f1dadd34fa9fccc72800ed206b8c274073dfd039">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f1dadd34fa9fccc72800ed206b8c274073dfd039</a></li>

<li>Use correctly-sized buffer when zero-filling a WAL file. I mixed up BLCKSZ and XLOG_BLCKSZ when I changed the way the buffer is allocated a couple of weeks ago. With the default settings, they are both 8k, but they can be changed at compile-time. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/848b9f05ab283724dd063d936a92568c1fdf422b">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/848b9f05ab283724dd063d936a92568c1fdf422b</a></li>

<li>Set the all-visible flag on heap page before writing WAL record, not after. If we set the all-visible flag after writing WAL record, and XLogInsert takes a full-page image of the page, the image would not include the flag. We will then proceed to set the VM bit, which would then be set without the corresponding all-visible flag on the heap page. Found by comparing page images on master and standby, after writing/replaying each WAL record. (There is still a discrepancy: the all-visible flag won't be set after replaying the HEAP_CLEAN record, even though it is set in the master. However, it will be set when replaying the HEAP2_VISIBLE record and setting the VM bit, so the all-visible flag and VM bit are always consistent on the standby, even though they are momentarily out-of-sync with master) Backpatch to 9.3 where this code was introduced.

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix bogus handling of bad strategy number in GIST consistent() functions. Make sure we throw an error instead of silently doing the wrong thing when fed a strategy number we don't recognize. Also, in the places that did already throw an error, spell the error message in a way more consistent with our message style guidelines. Per report from Paul Jones. Although this is a bug, it won't occur unless a superuser tries to do something he shouldn't, so it doesn't seem worth back-patching. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4dfb065b3ab662dcc96d07ee7fc9dadf6975a0cb">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4dfb065b3ab662dcc96d07ee7fc9dadf6975a0cb</a></li>

<li>Use AF_UNSPEC not PF_UNSPEC in getaddrinfo calls. According to the Single Unix Spec and assorted man pages, you're supposed to use the constants named AF_xxx when setting ai_family for a getaddrinfo call. In a few places we were using PF_xxx instead. Use of PF_xxx appears to be an ancient BSD convention that was not adopted by later standardization. On BSD and most later Unixen, it doesn't matter much because those constants have equivalent values anyway; but nonetheless this code is not per spec. In the same vein, replace PF_INET by AF_INET in one socket() call, which wasn't even consistent with the other socket() call in the same function let alone the remainder of our code. Per investigation of a Cygwin trouble report from Marco Atzeri. It's probably a long shot that this will fix his issue, but it's wrong in any case. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cad4fe6455bdc9ef1026b4a247eeb588ab3a8bd6">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cad4fe6455bdc9ef1026b4a247eeb588ab3a8bd6</a></li>

<li>Update oidjoins regression test for 9.4. Now that we're pretty much feature-frozen, it's time to update the checks on system catalog foreign-key references. (It looks like we missed doing this altogether for 9.3. Sigh.) 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cbb5e23bfa92973bddf11935448a9d42c32f7d42">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cbb5e23bfa92973bddf11935448a9d42c32f7d42</a></li>

<li>Fix contrib/postgres_fdw's remote-estimate representation of array Params. We were emitting "(SELECT null::typename)", which is usually interpreted as a scalar subselect, but not so much in the context "x = ANY(...)". This led to remote-side parsing failures when remote_estimate is enabled. A quick and ugly fix is to stick in an extra cast step, "((SELECT null::typename)::typename)". The cast will be thrown away as redundant by parse analysis, but not before it's done its job of making sure the grammar sees the ANY argument as an a_expr rather than a select_with_parens. Per an example from Hannu Krosing. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5b68d81697bcb0d16136bd037e454ee53c521185">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5b68d81697bcb0d16136bd037e454ee53c521185</a></li>

<li>Rename EXPLAIN ANALYZE's "total runtime" output to "execution time". Now that EXPLAIN also outputs a "planning time" measurement, the use of "total" here seems rather confusing: it sounds like it might include the planning time which of course it doesn't. Majority opinion was that "execution time" is a better label, so we'll call it that. This should be noted as a backwards incompatibility for tools that examine EXPLAIN ANALYZE output. In passing, I failed to resist the temptation to do a little editing on the materialized-view example affected by this change.

<li>vacuumdb: Add option --analyze-in-stages. Add vacuumdb option --analyze-in-stages which runs ANALYZE three times with different configuration settings, adopting the logic from the analyze_new_cluster.sh script that pg_upgrade generates. That way, users of pg_dump/pg_restore can also use that functionality. Change pg_upgrade to create the script so that it calls vacuumdb instead of implementing the logic itself.

<li>Create function prototype as part of PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1 macro Because of gcc -Wmissing-prototypes, all functions in dynamically loadable modules must have a separate prototype declaration. This is meant to detect global functions that are not declared in header files, but in cases where the function is called via dfmgr, this is redundant. Besides filling up space with boilerplate, this is a frequent source of compiler warnings in extension modules. We can fix that by creating the function prototype as part of the PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1 macro, which such modules have to use anyway. That makes the code of modules cleaner, because there is one less place where the entry points have to be listed, and creates an additional check that functions have the right prototype. Remove now redundant prototypes from contrib and other modules.

<li>Fix timeout in LDAP lookup of libpq connection parameters. Bind attempts to an LDAP server should time out after two seconds, allowing additional lines in the service control file to be parsed (which provide a fall back to a secondary LDAP server or default options). The existing code failed to enforce that timeout during TCP connect, resulting in a hang far longer than two seconds if the LDAP server does not respond. Laurenz Albe

<p>Andrew Dunstan a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Attempt to get plpython regression tests working again for MSVC builds. This has probably been broken for quite a long time. Buildfarm member currawong's current results suggest that it's been broken since 9.1, so backpatch this to that branch. This only supports Python 2 - I will handle Python 3 separately, but this is a fairly simple fix.

<p>Alvaro Herrera a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix object identities for text search objects. We were neglecting to schema-qualify them. Backpatch to 9.3, where object identities were introduced as a concept by commit f8348ea32ec8.
