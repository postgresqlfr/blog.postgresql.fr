<ul>

<li>Use a pairing heap for the priority queue in kNN-GiST searches. This performs slightly better, uses less memory, and needs slightly less code in GiST, than the Red-Black tree previously used. Reviewed by Peter Geoghegan

<li>Turn much of the btree_gin macros into real functions. This makes the functions much nicer to read and edit, and also makes debugging easier.

<li>Move rbtree.c from src/backend/utils/misc to src/backend/lib. We have other general-purpose data structures in src/backend/lib, so it seems like a better home for the red-black tree as well.

<li>Further tidy up on json aggregate documentation

<li>Fix documentation of argument type of json_agg and jsonb_agg. json_agg was originally designed to aggregate records. However, it soon became clear that it is useful for aggregating all kinds of values and that's what we have on 9.3 and 9.4, and in head for it and jsonb_agg. The documentation suggested otherwise, so this fixes it.

<ul>

<li>Change local_preload_libraries to PGC_USERSET. This allows it to be used with ALTER ROLE SET. Although the old setting of PGC_BACKEND prevented changes after session start, after discussion it was more useful to allow ALTER ROLE SET instead and just document that changes during a session have no effect. This is similar to how session_preload_libraries works already. An alternative would be to change things to allow PGC_BACKEND and PGC_SU_BACKEND settings to be changed by ALTER ROLE SET. But that might need further research (e.g., log_connections would probably not work). based on patch by Kyotaro Horiguchi

<p>&Aacute;lvaro Herrera a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>get_object_address: separate domain constraints from table constraints. Apart from enabling comments on domain constraints, this enables a future project to replicate object dropping to remote servers: with the current mechanism there's no way to distinguish between the two types of constraints, so there's no way to know what to drop. Also added support for the domain constraint comments in psql's \dd and pg_dump. Catalog version bumped due to the change in ObjectType enum.

<li>Use a bitmask to represent role attributes. The previous representation using a boolean column for each attribute would not scale as well as we want to add further attributes. Extra auxilliary functions are added to go along with this change, to make up for the lost convenience of access of the old representation. Catalog version bumped due to change in catalogs and the new functions. Author: Adam Brightwell, minor tweaks by &Aacute;lvaro Reviewed by: Stephen Frost, Andres Freund, &Aacute;lvaro Herrera 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1826987a46d079458007b7b6bbcbbd852353adbb">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1826987a46d079458007b7b6bbcbbd852353adbb</a></li>

<li>Add SQL-callable pg_get_object_address. This allows access to get_object_address from SQL, which is useful to obtain OID addressing information from data equivalent to that emitted by the parser. This is necessary infrastructure of a project to let replication systems propagate object dropping events to remote servers, where the schema might be different than the server originating the DROP. This patch also adds support for OBJECT_DEFAULT to get_object_address; that is, it is now possible to refer to a column's default value. Catalog version bumped due to the new function.

<li>Revert "Use a bitmask to represent role attributes". This reverts commit 1826987a46d079458007b7b6bbcbbd852353adbb. The overall design was deemed unacceptable, in discussion following the previous commit message; we might find some parts of it still salvageable, but I don't want to be on the hook for fixing it, so let's wait until we have a new patch. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a609d96778c1714b9af916477b2c30891fbe578a">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a609d96778c1714b9af916477b2c30891fbe578a</a></li>

<li>Grab heavyweight tuple lock only before sleeping. We were trying to acquire the lock even when we were subsequently not sleeping in some other transaction, which opens us up unnecessarily to deadlocks. In particular, this is troublesome if an update tries to lock an updated version of a tuple and finds itself doing EvalPlanQual update chain walking; more than two sessions doing this concurrently will find themselves sleeping on each other because the HW tuple lock acquisition in heap_lock_tuple called from EvalPlanQualFetch races with the same tuple lock being acquired in heap_update -- one of these sessions sleeps on the other one to finish while holding the tuple lock, and the other one sleeps on the tuple lock. Per trouble report from Andrew Sackville-West in

In the future, if we improve isolationtester, it would be good to include the spec file in the isolation schedule.

<li>Remove event trigger from object_address test. It is causing trouble when run in parallel mode, because dropping the function other sessions are running concurrently causes them to fail due to inability to find the function. Per buildfarm, as noted by Tom Lane.

<li>Remove failing collation case from object_address regression test. Per buildfarm, this test case does not yield consistent results. I don't think it's useful enough to figure out a workaround, either.

<li>Add CST (China Standard Time) to our lists of timezone abbreviations. For some reason this seems to have been missed when the lists in src/timezone/tznames/ were first constructed. We can't put it in Default because of the conflict with US CST, but we should certainly list it among the alternative entries in Asia.txt. (I checked for other oversights, but all the other abbreviations that are in current use according to the IANA files seem to be accounted for.) Noted while responding to bug #12326.

<li>Temporarily revert "Move pg_lzcompress.c to src/common." This reverts commit 60838df922345b26a616e49ac9fab808a35d1f85. That change needs a bit more thought to be workable. In view of the potentially machine-dependent stuff that went in today, we need all of the buildfarm to be testing those other changes.

<li>Move pg_lzcompress.c to src/common. Exposing compression and decompression APIs of pglz makes possible its use by extensions and contrib modules. pglz_decompress contained a call to elog to emit an error message in case of corrupted data. This function is changed to return a status code to let its callers return an error instead. This commit is required for upcoming WAL compression feature so that the WAL reader facility can decompress the WAL data by using pglz_decompress. Michael Paquier

<li>Convert the PGPROC-&gt;lwWaitLink list into a dlist instead of open coding it. Besides being shorter and much easier to read it changes the logic in LWLockRelease() to release all shared lockers when waking up any. This can yield some significant performance improvements - and the fairness isn't really much worse than before, as we always allowed new shared lockers to jump the queue.

<li>Add capability to suppress CONTEXT: messages to elog machinery. Hiding context messages usually is not a good idea - except for rather verbose debugging/development utensils like LOG_DEBUG. There the amount of repeated context messages just bloat the log without adding information.

<li>Lockless StrategyGetBuffer clock sweep hot path. StrategyGetBuffer() has proven to be a bottleneck in a number of buffer acquisition heavy workloads. To some degree this has already been alleviated by 5d7962c6, but it still can be quite a heavy bottleneck. The problem is that in unfortunate usage patterns a single StrategyGetBuffer() call will have to look at a large number of buffers - in turn making it likely that the process will be put to sleep while still holding the spinlock. Replace most of the usage of the buffer_strategy_lock spinlock for the clock sweep by a atomic nextVictimBuffer variable. That variable, modulo NBuffers, is the current hand of the clock sweep. The buffer clock-sweep then only needs to acquire the spinlock after a wraparound. And even then only in the process that did the wrapping around. That alleviates nearly all the contention on the relevant spinlock, although significant contention on the cacheline can still exist. Reviewed-By: Robert Haas and Amit Kapila.

<li>Improve LWLock scalability. The old LWLock implementation had the problem that concurrent lock acquisitions required exclusively acquiring a spinlock. Often that could lead to acquirers waiting behind the spinlock, even if the actual LWLock was free. The new implementation doesn't acquire the spinlock when acquiring the lock itself. Instead the new atomic operations are used to atomically manipulate the state. Only the waitqueue, used solely in the slow path, is still protected by the spinlock. Check lwlock.c's header for an explanation about the used algorithm. For some common workloads on larger machines this can yield significant performance improvements. Particularly in read mostly workloads. Reviewed-By: Amit Kapila and Robert Haas. Author: Andres Freund. Discussion: 20130926225545.GB26663@awork2.anarazel.de
