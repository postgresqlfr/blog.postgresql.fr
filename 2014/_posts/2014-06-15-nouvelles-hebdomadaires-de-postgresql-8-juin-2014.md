<li>doc: fix JSON function prototype variable label. from_jsonb -&gt; from_json, for consistency. Patch by rudolf (private report)

<li>Use unaligned output in another regression test query to reduce diff noise. Use the unaligned/no rowcount output mode in a regression tests that shows all built-in leakproof functions. Currently a new leakproof function will often change the alignment of all existing functions, making it hard to see the actual difference and creating unnecessary patch conflicts. Noticed while looking over a patch introducing new leakproof functions. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5eebb8d954adf9d600b1a157682539db1e8a3ada">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/5eebb8d954adf9d600b1a157682539db1e8a3ada</a></li>

<li>Set the process latch when processing recovery conflict interrupts. Because RecoveryConflictInterrupt() didn't set the process latch anything using the latter to wait for events didn't get notified about recovery conflicts. Most latch users are never the target of recovery conflicts, which explains the lack of reports about this until now. Since 9.3 two possible affected users exist though: The sql callable pg_sleep() now uses latches to wait and background workers are expected to use latches in their main loop. Both would currently wait until the end of WaitLatch's timeout. Fix by adding a SetLatch() to RecoveryConflictInterrupt(). It'd also be possible to fix the issue by having each latch user set set_latch_on_sigusr1. That seems failure prone and though, as most of these callsites won't often receive recovery conflicts and thus will likely only be tested against normal query cancels et al. It'd also be unnecessarily verbose. Backpatch to 9.1 where latches were introduced. Arguably 9.3 would be sufficient, because that's where pg_sleep() was converted to waiting on the latch and background workers got introduced; but there could be user level code making use of the latch pre 9.3.

<li>Fix longstanding bug in HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum(). HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum() didn't properly discern between DELETE_IN_PROGRESS and INSERT_IN_PROGRESS for rows that have been inserted in the current transaction and deleted in a aborted subtransaction of the current backend. At the very least that caused problems for CLUSTER and CREATE INDEX in transactions that had aborting subtransactions producing rows, leading to warnings like: WARNING: concurrent delete in progress within table "..." possibly in an endless, uninterruptible, loop. Instead of treating *InProgress xmins the same as *IsCurrent ones, treat them as being distinct like the other visibility routines. As implemented this separatation can cause a behaviour change for rows that have been inserted and deleted in another, still running, transaction. HTSV will now return INSERT_IN_PROGRESS instead of DELETE_IN_PROGRESS for those. That's both, more in line with the other visibility routines and arguably more correct. The latter because a INSERT_IN_PROGRESS will make callers look at/wait for xmin, instead of xmax. The only current caller where that's possibly worse than the old behaviour is heap_prune_chain() which now won't mark the page as prunable if a row has concurrently been inserted and deleted. That's harmless enough. As a cautionary measure also insert a interrupt check before the gotos in IndexBuildHeapScan() that lead to the uninterruptible loop. There are other possible causes, like a row that several sessions try to update and all fail, for repeated loops and the cost of doing so in the retry case is low. As this bug goes back all the way to the introduction of subtransactions in 573a71a5da backpatch to all supported releases. Reported-By: Sandro Santilli

<li>Move regression test listing of builtin leakproof functions to opr_sanity.sql. The original location in create_function_3.sql didn't invite the close structinity warranted for adding new leakproof functions. Add comments to the test explaining that functions should only be added after careful consideration and understanding what a leakproof function is. Per complaint from Tom Lane after 5eebb8d954ad. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e0cb4aa89dd61cb1a76d348ced634681255b6a07">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e0cb4aa89dd61cb1a76d348ced634681255b6a07</a></li>

<li>Consistently spell a replication slot's name as slot_name. Previously there's been a mix between 'slotname' and 'slot_name'. It's not nice to be unneccessarily inconsistent in a new feature. As a post beta1 initdb now is required in the wake of eeca4cd35e, fix the inconsistencies. Most the changes won't affect usage of replication slots because the majority of changes is around function parameter names. The prominent exception to that is that the recovery.conf parameter 'primary_slotname' is now named 'primary_slot_name'. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f0c108560bce3a5481db57ffc3743e71b5f7b2d1">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f0c108560bce3a5481db57ffc3743e71b5f7b2d1</a></li>

<li>Fix off-by-one in decoding causing one-record events to be skipped. A ReorderBufferTransaction's end_lsn, the sentPtr advocated by walsender keepalive messages, and the end location remembered by the decoding get_*changes* SQL functions all use the location of the last read record + 1. I.e. the LSN points to the beginning of the next record. That cannot realistically be changed without changing the replication protocol because that's how keepalive messages have worked since 9.0. The bug is that the logic inside the snapshot builder, which decides whether a transaction's contents should be decoded, assumed the start location would point towards the last byte of the last record. The reason this didn't actually cause visible problems is that currently that decision is only made for commit records. Since interesting transactions always have at least one additional record - containing actual data - we'd never skip a transaction. But if there ever were transactions, or other events, with just one record containing important information, we'd skip them after stopping and restarting logical decoding.

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<li>Make plpython_unicode regression test work in more database encodings. This test previously used a data value containing U+0080, and would therefore fail if the database encoding didn't have an equivalent to that; which only about half of our supported server encodings do. We could fall back to using some plain-ASCII character, but that seems like it's losing most of the point of the test. Instead switch to using U+00A0 (no-break space), which translates into all our supported encodings except the four in the EUC_xx family. Per buildfarm testing. Back-patch to 9.1, which is as far back as this test is expected to succeed everywhere. (9.0 has the test, but without back-patching some 9.1 code changes we could not expect to get consistent results across platforms anyway.) 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2dfa15de5510b3c19ffb92b512c39d5440a07b1e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2dfa15de5510b3c19ffb92b512c39d5440a07b1e</a></li>

<li>Bump PG_CONTROL_VERSION for previous 9.4 changes. This should have been done in 6bc8ef0b7f1f1df3998745a66e1790e27424aa0c and/or 50e547096c4858a68abf09894667a542cc418315, but better late than never. If we don't change this then we risk 9.3 pg_controldata or pg_resetxlog being inappropriately used against a 9.4 pg_control file, or vice versa. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/eeca4cd35e284c72b2ea1b4494e64e7738896e81">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/eeca4cd35e284c72b2ea1b4494e64e7738896e81</a></li>

<li>Add btree and hash opclasses for pg_lsn. This is needed to allow ORDER BY, DISTINCT, etc to work as expected for pg_lsn values. We had previously decided to put this off for 9.5, but in view of commit eeca4cd35e284c72b2ea1b4494e64e7738896e81 there's no reason to avoid a catversion bump for 9.4beta2, and this does make a pretty significant usability difference for pg_lsn. Michael Paquier, with fixes from Andres Freund and Tom Lane

<li>Tweak new regression test case for better portability. Buildfarm says we get different plans on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, probably because of MAXALIGN-related differences in memory-consumption calculations. Add some dummy WHERE clauses so that the planner estimates different sizes for the three generate_series() relations; that should stabilize the choice of join order. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d4d48a5edd9eb28a7f2ee2e4cbe20d984274982e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/d4d48a5edd9eb28a7f2ee2e4cbe20d984274982e</a></li>

<li>Add defenses against running with a wrong selection of LOBLKSIZE. It's critical that the backend's idea of LOBLKSIZE match the way data has actually been divided up in pg_largeobject. While we don't provide any direct way to adjust that value, doing so is a one-line source code change and various people have expressed interest recently in changing it. So, just as with TOAST_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE, it seems prudent to record the value in pg_control and cross-check that the backend's compiled-in setting matches the on-disk data. Also tweak the code in inv_api.c so that fetches from pg_largeobject explicitly verify that the length of the data field is not more than LOBLKSIZE. Formerly we just had Asserts() for that, which is no protection at all in production builds. In some of the call sites an overlength data value would translate directly to a security-relevant stack clobber, so it seems worth one extra runtime comparison to be sure. In the back branches, we can't change the contents of pg_control; but we can still make the extra checks in inv_api.c, which will offer some amount of protection against running with the wrong value of LOBLKSIZE.

<li>Output timestamps in ISO 8601 format when rendering JSON. Many JSON processors require timestamp strings in ISO 8601 format in order to convert the strings. When converting a timestamp, with or without timezone, to a JSON datum we therefore now use such a format rather than the type's default text output, in functions such as to_json(). This is a change in behaviour from 9.2 and 9.3, as noted in the release notes. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f30015b6d794c15d52abbb3df3a65081fbefb1ed">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f30015b6d794c15d52abbb3df3a65081fbefb1ed</a></li>

<li>Do not escape a unicode sequence when escaping JSON text. Previously, any backslash in text being escaped for JSON was doubled so that the result was still valid JSON. However, this led to some perverse results in the case of Unicode sequences, These are now detected and the initial backslash is no longer escaped. All other backslashes are still escaped. No validity check is performed, all that is looked for is \uXXXX where X is a hexidecimal digit. This is a change from the 9.2 and 9.3 behaviour as noted in the Release notes. Per complaint from Teodor Sigaev.

<li>Use EncodeDateTime instead of to_char to render JSON timestamps. Per gripe from Peter Eisentraut and Tom Lane. The output is slightly different, but still ISO 8601 compliant: to_char doesn't output the minutes when time zone offset is an integer number of hours, while EncodeDateTime outputs ":00". The code is slightly adapted from code in xml.c

<li>Silence Bison deprecation warnings. Bison &gt;=3.0 issues warnings about %name-prefix="base_yy" instead of the now preferred %name-prefix "base_yy" but the latter doesn't work with Bison 2.3 or less. So for now we silence the deprecation warnings.

<li>Save pg_stat_statements statistics file into $PGDATA/pg_stat directory at shutdown. 187492b6c2e8cafc5b39063ca3b67846e8155d24 changed pgstat.c so that the stats files were saved into $PGDATA/pg_stat directory when the server was shutdowned. But it accidentally forgot to change the location of pg_stat_statements permanent stats file. This commit fixes pg_stat_statements so that its stats file is also saved into $PGDATA/pg_stat at shutdown. Since this fix changes the file layout, we don't back-patch it to 9.3 where this oversight was introduced.

<p>Heikki Linnakangas a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Adjust SP-GiST WAL record formats to reduce alignment padding. The way the code was written, the padding was copied from uninitialized memory areas.. Because the structs are local variables in the code where the WAL records are constructed, making them larger and zeroing the padding bytes would not make the code very pretty, so rather than fixing this directly by zeroing out the padding bytes, it seems more clear to not try to align the tuples in the WAL records. The redo functions are taught to copy the tuple header to a local variable to avoid unaligned access. Stable-branches have the same problem, but we can't change the WAL format there, so fix in master only. Reading a few random extra bytes at the stack is harmless in practice, so it's not worth crafting a different back-patchable fix. Per reports from Kevin Grittner and Andres Freund, using clang static analyzer and Valgrind, respectively.
