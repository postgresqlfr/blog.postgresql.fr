<li>Add a function to get the authenticated user ID. Previously, this was not exposed outside of miscinit.c. It is needed for the pending pg_background patch, and will also be needed for parallelism. Without it, there's no way for a background worker to re-create the exact authentication environment that was present in the process that started it, which could lead to security exposures.

<li>Perform less setup work for AFTER triggers at transaction start. Testing reveals that the memory allocation we do at transaction start has small but measurable overhead on simple transactions. To cut down on that overhead, defer some of that work to the point when AFTER triggers are first used, thus avoiding it altogether if they never are. Patch by me. Review by Andres Freund.

<li>Fix file-identification comment in contrib/pgcrypto/pgcrypto--1.2.sql. Cosmetic oversight in commit 32984d8fc3dbb90a3fafb69fece0134f1ea790f9. Marko Tiikkaja

<li>Fix mishandling of FieldSelect-on-whole-row-Var in nested lateral queries. If an inline-able SQL function taking a composite argument is used in a LATERAL subselect, and the composite argument is a lateral reference, the planner could fail with "variable not found in subplan target list", as seen in bug #11703 from Karl Bartel. (The outer function call used in the bug report and in the committed regression test is not really necessary to provoke the bug --- you can get it if you manually expand the outer function into "LATERAL (SELECT inner_function(outer_relation))", too.) The cause of this is that we generate the reltargetlist for the referenced relation before doing eval_const_expressions() on the lateral sub-select's expressions (cf find_lateral_references()), so what's scheduled to be emitted by the referenced relation is a whole-row Var, not the simplified single-column Var produced by optimizing the function's FieldSelect on the whole-row Var. Then setrefs.c fails to match up that lateral reference to what's available from the outer scan. Preserving the FieldSelect optimization in such cases would require either major planner restructuring (to recursively do expression simplification on sub-selects much earlier) or some amazingly ugly kluge to change the reltargetlist of a possibly-already-planned relation. It seems better just to skip the optimization when the Var is from an upper query level; the case is not so common that it's likely anyone will notice a few wasted cycles. AFAICT this problem only occurs for uplevel LATERAL references, so back-patch to 9.3 where LATERAL was added.

<li>Update expected/sequence_1.out. The last three updates to the sequence regression test have all forgotten to touch the alternate expected-output file. Sigh. Michael Paquier

<li>Ensure libpq reports a suitable error message on unexpected socket EOF. The EOF-detection logic in pqReadData was a bit confused about who should set up the error message in case the kernel gives us read-ready-but-no-data rather than ECONNRESET or some other explicit error condition. Since the whole point of this situation is that the lower-level functions don't know there's anything wrong, pqReadData itself must set up the message. But keep the assumption that if an errno was reported, a message was set up at lower levels. Per bug #11712 from Marko Tiikkaja. It's been like this for a very long time, so back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Improve ispell dictionary's defenses against bad affix files. Don't crash if an ispell dictionary definition contains flags but not any compound affixes. (This isn't a security issue since only superusers can install affix files, but still it's a bad thing.) Also, be more careful about detecting whether an affix-file FLAG command is old-format (ispell) or new-format (myspell/hunspell). And change the error message about mixed old-format and new-format commands into something intelligible. Per bug #11770 from Emre Hasegeli. Back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>In type_sanity, check I/O functions of built-in types are not volatile. We have a project policy that I/O functions must not be volatile, as per commit aab353a60b95aadc00f81da0c6d99bde696c4b75, but we weren't doing anything to enforce that. In most usage the marking of the function doesn't matter as long as its behavior is sane --- but I/O casts can expose the marking as user-visible behavior, as per today's complaint from Joe Van Dyk about contrib/ltree. This test as such will only protect us against future errors in built-in data types. To catch the same error in contrib or third-party types, perhaps we should make CREATE TYPE complain? But that's a separate issue from enforcing the policy for built-in types.

<li>Improve planning of btree index scans using ScalarArrayOpExpr quals. Since we taught btree to handle ScalarArrayOpExpr quals natively (commit 9e8da0f75731aaa7605cf4656c21ea09e84d2eb1), the planner has always included ScalarArrayOpExpr quals in index conditions if possible. However, if the qual is for a non-first index column, this could result in an inferior plan because we can no longer take advantage of index ordering (cf. commit 807a40c551dd30c8dd5a0b3bd82f5bbb1e7fd285). It can be better to omit the ScalarArrayOpExpr qual from the index condition and let it be done as a filter, so that the output doesn't need to get sorted. Indeed, this is true for the query introduced as a test case by the latter commit. To fix, restructure get_index_paths and build_index_paths so that we consider paths both with and without ScalarArrayOpExpr quals in non-first index columns. Redesign the API of build_index_paths so that it reports what it found, saving useless second or third calls. Report and patch by Andrew Gierth (though rather heavily modified by me). Back-patch to 9.2 where this code was introduced, since the issue can result in significant performance regressions compared to plans produced by 9.1 and earlier.

<li>Fix undersized result buffer in pset_quoted_string(). The malloc request was 1 byte too small for the worst-case output. This seems relatively unlikely to cause any problems in practice, as the worst case only occurs if the input string contains no characters other than single-quote or newline, and even then malloc alignment padding would probably save the day. But it's definitely a bug. David Rowley

<li>Avoid unportable strftime() behavior in pg_dump/pg_dumpall. Commit ad5d46a4494b0b480a3af246bb4227d9bdadca37 thought that we could get around the known portability issues of strftime's %Z specifier by using %z instead. However, that idea seems to have been innocent of any actual research, as it certainly missed the facts that (1) %z is not portable to pre-C99 systems, and (2) %z doesn't actually act differently from %Z on Windows anyway. Per failures on buildfarm member hamerkop. While at it, centralize the code defining what strftime format we want to use in pg_dump; three copies of that string seems a bit much.

<p>Andrew Dunstan a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<li>Correct volatility markings of a few json functions. json_agg and json_object_agg and their associated transition functions should have been marked as stable rather than immutable, as they call IO functions indirectly. Changing this probably isn't going to make much difference, as you can't use an aggregate function in an index expression, but we should be correct nevertheless. json_object, on the other hand, should be marked immutable rather than stable, as it does not call IO functions. As discussed on -hackers, this change is being made without bumping the catalog version, as we don't want to do that at this stage of the cycle, and the changes are very unlikely to affect anyone.

<li>doc: Check DocBook XML validity during the build. Building the documentation with XSLT does not check the DTD, like a DSSSL build would. One can often get away with having invalid XML, but the stylesheets might then create incorrect output, as they are not designed to handle that. Therefore, check the validity of the XML against the DTD, using xmllint, during the build. Add xmllint detection to configure, and add some documentation. xmllint comes with libxml2, which is already in use, but it might be in a separate package, such as libxml2-utils on Debian.

<li>Flush unlogged table's buffers when copying or moving databases. CREATE DATABASE and ALTER DATABASE .. SET TABLESPACE copy the source database directory on the filesystem level. To ensure the on disk state is consistent they block out users of the affected database and force a checkpoint to flush out all data to disk. Unfortunately, up to now, that checkpoint didn't flush out dirty buffers from unlogged relations. That bug means there could be leftover dirty buffers in either the template database, or the database in its old location. Leading to problems when accessing relations in an inconsistent state; and to possible problems during shutdown in the SET TABLESPACE case because buffers belonging files that don't exist anymore are flushed. This was reported in bug #10675 by Maxim Boguk. Fix by Pavan Deolasee, modified somewhat by me. Reviewed by MauMau and Fujii Masao. Backpatch to 9.1 where unlogged tables were introduced.

<li>Renumber CHECKPOINT_* flags. Commit 7dbb6069382 added a new CHECKPOINT_FLUSH_ALL flag. As that commit needed to be backpatched I didn't change the numeric values of the existing flags as that could lead to nastly problems if any external code issued checkpoints. That's not a concern on master, so renumber them there. Also add a comment about CHECKPOINT_FLUSH_ALL above CreateCheckPoint().

<li>Don't duplicate log_checkpoint messages for both of restart and checkpoints. The duplication originated in cdd46c765, where restartpoints were introduced. In LogCheckpointStart's case the duplication actually lead to the compiler's format string checking not to be effective because the format string wasn't constant. Arguably these messages shouldn't be elog(), but ereport() style messages. That'd even allow to translate the messages... But as there's more mistakes of that kind in surrounding code, it seems better to change that separately.

<li>MinGW: Link with shell32.dll instead of shfolder.dll. This improves consistency with the MSVC build. On buildfarm member narwhal, since commit 846e91e0223cf9f2821c3ad4dfffffbb929cb027, shfolder.dll:SHGetFolderPath() crashes when dblink calls it by way of pqGetHomeDirectory(). Back-patch to 9.4, where that commit first appeared. How it caused this regression remains a mystery. This is a partial revert of commit 889f03812916b146ae504c0fad5afdc7bf2e8a2a, which adopted shfolder.dll for Windows NT 4.0 compatibility. PostgreSQL 8.2 dropped support for that operating system.

<li>Work around Windows locale name with non-ASCII character. Windows has one a locale whose name contains a non-ASCII character: "Norwegian (Bokm&aring;l)" (that's an 'a' with a ring on top). That causes trouble; when passing it setlocale(), it's not clear what encoding the argument should be in. Another problem is that the locale name is stored in pg_database catalog table, and the encoding used there depends on what server encoding happens to be in use when the database is created. For example, if you issue the CREATE DATABASE when connected to a UTF-8 database, the locale name is stored in pg_database in UTF-8. As long as all locale names are pure ASCII, that's not a problem. To work around that, map the troublesome locale name to a pure-ASCII alias of the same locale, "norwegian-bokmal". Now, this doesn't change the existing values that are already in pg_database and in postgresql.conf. Old clusters will need to be fixed manually. Instructions for that need to be put in the release notes. This fixes bug #11431 reported by Alon Siman-Tov. Backpatch to 9.2; backpatching further would require more work than seems worth it.

<li>Prevent the already-archived WAL file from being archived again. Previously the archive recovery always created .ready file for the last WAL file of the old timeline at the end of recovery even when it's restored from the archive and has .done file. That is, there was the case where the WAL file had both .ready and .done files. This caused the already-archived WAL file to be archived again. This commit prevents the archive recovery from creating .ready file for the last WAL file if it has .done file, in order to prevent it from being archived again. This bug was added when cascading replication feature was introduced, i.e., the commit 5286105800c7d5902f98f32e11b209c471c0c69c. So, back-patch to 9.2, where cascading replication was added.

<li>Remove the unused argument of PSQLexec(). This commit simply removes the second argument of PSQLexec that was set to the same value everywhere. Comments and code blocks related to this parameter are removed. Noticed by Heikki Linnakangas, reviewed by Michael Paquier

<li>psql: complain if pg_dump custom-format is detected. Apparently, this is a very common mistake for users to make; it is better to have it fail reasonably rather than throw potentially a large number of errors. Since we have a magic string at the start of the file, we can detect the case easily and there's no other possible useful behavior anyway. Author: Craig Ringer
